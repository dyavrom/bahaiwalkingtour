Just as it is imposing and distinguished above all others.\" On May 10th He drove from the educational society with Mr. Fareed, Mrs. Parsons, and Mr. Bagdadi to the Capitol. He expressed a wish to go inside where He examined the statuary and paintings. He walked in the grounds and sat for a short time near a large tree. As you walk the gardens you may imagine which tree the Master sat near, you may look for the tree which stood as a living witness to the Master's visit. On April 24, 1912, east of the Capitol Building a red oak tree was planted by Representative William J. Browning of New Jersey. He was given the honor of planting the tree, in respect for his 16 years as chief clerk of the House of Representatives of the United States. The Commemorative trees are marked with plaques which include the person, place or event being paid tribute; the date the tree was planted; and the name of the Member of Congress who sponsored the tree planting. The gardens the Master spoke of include 50,000 annual flowers and 70,000 tulips and spring bulbs which are planted each year.

              "Welcome to the Ripley House at 1336 Harvard Street NW, where the Master had arranged for Himself and his entourage to stay during his May 1912 visit to Washington, DC. Earlier in the year, He had cabled ahead of His April arrival that an apartment should be rented for Him and His entourage. Mr. and Mrs. W. P. Ripley and their daughter Elizabeth vacated their first floor apartment and moved to 2626 University Place NW to stay with the Barnitz family. On the 20th of April, directly from Union Station, the Master arrived at the apartment and said that He liked it very much and will stay here during His May visit. Some of his entourage began staying here in April, while He went to the Parsons home. On May 8th, preparations were made for the Master's visit with Mrs. Parsons bringing fresh flowers and sweets to the house and Ms. Hebe Jean Moore and Mrs. Harlan Ober taking \"charge of the Master's house,\" for the duration of His stay. The Master arrived later that evening at 8pm to the apartment. No recorded talks were given at the house as events were being held elsewhere. However, visitors came to the house regularly for personal visits. On the morning of May 9th there was a continuous stream of visitors to the house until noon. One visit of note was that of Mr. Spicer Simon the medalist who drew sketches of the Master on the early morning of May 10th, and then composed a \"very good likeness\" of the Master in metal. Finally, on May 11th the Master received guests to say \"good-bye\" leaving directly to Union Station in a horse-drawn carriage. The Ripley family would go on to pioneer the Faith to Orlando, Florida later in 1912. Infused with devotion through their close contact with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, the Ripley family remained steadfast despite pioneering alone in Central Florida. Just prior to his passing, Mr. Ripley had three Faith seeking women over for tea who liked to refer to themselves as \"We Three,\" they would go on to form the core of the Orange County Bahá’í Community which continues to this day. The house was built in 1911 selling for $6000, and considered an elegant residence alongside those of Congressmen. In 2006 the house was renovated into the three condominiums it is today.",

From the Ripley House he arrived at this house on April 20th, when it became the first house in America in which He slept. With a capacity for over 250 individuals, it also hosted many famous visitors including former President Theodore Roosevelt, and the Supreme Court Appointee abolitionist Oliver Wendell Homes Jr. whose wife's women's group had heard the Master the day before at their Unitarian Church. To the Judge he said \"Just as there is unity amongst the United States, in a like manner it is possible to have unity amongst the nations of the world. What is the verdict judge?\" The Judge replied \"it is all right,\" to which the Master smiled. One particularly memorable day on April 27th, 12 Bahá’ís who had never gone on pilgrimage were chosen by community secretary Leone St. Clair Barnitz to meet the Master in a private audience. One such audience on April 23rd was recalled by Mary Jeannette Hill Anderson, \"Everyone there was gathered in the sun parlor which was beautifully decorated with an abundance of plants, caged birds, and elaborate furnishings. A number of the area’s wealthiest people were present. A hush fell over the room as ‘Abdu’l-Bahá entered, dressed in a flowing garment, sandals and a white turban on his head. All those present stood and broke into song. As “Joy to the World, the Lord has Come” filled the room, I wondered how He would know which baby would be named, as there were a number of children seeking His blessing. When all was quiet, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá walked toward me, took my tiny daughter in His arms, cuddling her close. He kissed her, blessed her, and named her in his native tongue - Mobarak.\" Years later, the child born just a month before the visit, remarked, \"I am fully aware of the Great Blessing bestowed upon me. This again shows the great love of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for all of mankind. I was a black child, a baby of no distinction, that this great man took time from His busy programs to name.\" In addition to numerous individual interviews, receptions were held at her home every afternoon at about 5:00 o'clock from Monday to Friday inclusive. The visits culminated in a reception in honor of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá under the auspices of the Persian-American Educational Society. Large numbers of representatives of the social and diplomatic life of the Capitol were in attendance who had become interested through Mrs. Parsons' afternoon receptions, as well as through the reception held at the Persian Legation. A famous photograph captured the Master's association with the house, which was taken of Him standing aside the south front porch pillar looking towards the street. The use of this beautiful home was arranged during a pilgrimage to Haifa by Ms. Parsons when the Master promised her, He would stay there. She purchased the land for it in 1908 and in December 1909 she commissioned Hornblower and Marshall to build it, having previously built the Natural History Building of the Smithsonian. In 1910, the house was completed with a grand foyer and hall for His talks. It is currently in use and under renovation by the German Marshall Fund an institution dedicated to promoting unity between North America and Europe. Mrs. Parsons continued to be central to the Bahá’í community and her most important task was destined to be her appointment to bring forth the first Race Amity Convention in America which occurred 9 years later in 1921.",

His first arrival was at 1:33 pm on Saturday April 20th, days of waiting were rewarded when, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá reached Washington on the Pennsylvania Railroad after a journey of five hours. Blessed to serve as a Pullman Car Porter on that train ride accompanying the Master was Bahá’í Alan A. Anderson Sr. In accordance with His expressed desire, there was no notice given of the hour of his arrival, and no delegation was to meet Him. The arrival was as simple as the Guest, and yet as memorable to those who were privileged to witness it, as the majestic simplicity of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá! The train was just on time. Among the usual crowd of travelers there was a quaint note lent by the party of people from Iran, in the midst of whom, cool, collected and ever the Master of the situation, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was seen. Quietly, he passed through the gates, stopping at the threshold to greet the children of Mírzá Alí Kuli Khan. The Master left Union Station in the car of Mrs. Barney-Hemmick. On November the 11th at 9am the Master left DC through Union Station for the last time, and, that departure brought to mind what the Master said following his April 28th departure at Union Station, \"this was the springtime; we had good meetings at your home; I shall never forget them. I hope that these spiritual links will become stronger day by day and that this communication of hearts, which is termed inspiration, will continue. When this connection exists, bodily separation is not important; this condition is beyond the world of worlds and above all description.\" Union Station, symbolizing a gateway to America, was completed of “Vermont Bethel white granite” in 1908 by Mr. Burnham, the principal architect of the 1893 Chicago World Fair at which the Bahá’í Faith was first mentioned publicly in America. Today 90,000 visitors continue to pass through Union Station's doors daily.",

Alice Pike developed the funds and culture to custom build, in 1903, such a beautiful Spanish Mission style home from her inheritance of her father's fortune as well as his keen sponsorship of the arts building Opera Houses in Cincinnati and New York. Her world was also global, as by 17 years of age she had the Bukerebe island in Tanzania named after her on Lake Victoria by Henry Morton Stanley to whom she was engaged at the time. Instead, she married Ohio Railroad scion Albert Barney and had two children, one of whom Laura Dreyfus-Barney would write Some Answered Questions and help translate Paris Talks. By ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's arrival she had married yet again, to be known as \"Ms. Hemmick\" to the Master. Alice's motor car drove the Master on the 21st from Union Station, eventually arriving at the Studio House and on the 25th again he arrived in a motor car. This time it was the motor car of Mrs. Hallie Davis Elkins, who like Alice, had inherited a great deal of her father's wealth and had suffered her husband's passing the year before, brought the Master to Alice's house. He called again on the house on the 26th and 28th of April. Then on the 10th of May He dined with Alice and her daughter Laura and son in law who was the first French Bahá’í Hippolyte Dreyfus-Barney. The couple had already accompanied the Master through England, France and Switzerland. The apartment that Mr. and Mrs. Dreyfus-Barney found in France for the Master became in 1998 a Bahá’í Place of reverence at 4 Avenue de Camoens where the Master stayed for nine weeks. This is very appropriate as May Bolles taught this family the Faith in Paris, in 1900, and together with classmates Mason Remey and the Hopper family all moved to Washington to advance the community significantly. From the seven members, Charlotte Brittingham Dixon had already established since 1898. The home was a reflection of the leading patroness of the arts in Washington, D.C., as well as one of its practitioners through her own art and theater projects. She was a recognized artist whose paintings are in the Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American Art and capture the images of some of the most significant Bahá’ís of Washington. Barney sought to broaden culture and the arts beyond Washington's elite to the general public and was instrumental in the 1917 founding the first federally funded theater in the nation, the National Sylvan Theater on the Washington Monument grounds. Laura and Natalie Barney, daughters of artist Alice Pike Barney, donated Studio House in 1961 to the Smithsonian Institution. Currently it serves as the embassy of Latvia.",

Three days later, He spoke to America's first Children's class which He personally had established in 1908 when Pauline Hannen had made pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Returning from pilgrimage she set up the classes as instructed, the first Baha'i Children classes outside of Iran at 11:15 am each Sunday with an Adult class as well for the study of bible prophecies and of the Ishrakat, Tarazat, Tajalleyat and Tablet of Paradise. On April 24th the children's reception was to be held. The hall was beautifully decorated with plants and cut flowers. The children were in the front seats and received His special attention. Each child came up to the Master took them in His arms, and patted them on the head asked them their names and kissed each one. One of the children, Jeffrey Parsons, having done so, stated to his mother \"It is like Jesus and the little children.\" The Master gave a small gift to every child. The children sang songs in praise of 'Abdu'l-Baha. He told the mothers that they had a great work to do to prepare the children for their life's work. At the close of this service He passed before each row, shaking the hand of every person present, some 200 or more, half of whom were children. On this occasion He appeared most happy. The children were also deeply affected, Pauline records how her own children reacted: \"Carl was nearly beside himself with joy, I was nearly dead, and wanted to rest, but this big boy of mine just hugged and kissed me over and over again, in thought going over the whole Meeting again and again with such evident Joy, that his Joy rested me. Have never seen Carl like that. Many people have since told me that the reception with the Children was the most heavenly Meeting of all, and I think so too. I have since found out who the little colored Baby was [Mobarak Anderson], that was named by 'Abdu'l- Baha on that occasion. The Father is a beautiful Believer [Alan A. Anderson Sr. a close friend of Mr. Louis George Gregory].\" To restate the impact the event had, one of the children present Marzieh Gail recalls the following, \"There was also Marzieh's own dim memory of the children's meeting in Washington. After Abdul-Baha'_ spoke, each child was told he should walk forward to where the Master was seated, and receive His blessing. Each child this was in the days when children were 'seen and not heard' sedately walked alone down the aisle to Him, stood beside Him, was patted and blessed, and walked sedately back. But Marzieh, when it came her turn, exploded from her chair, bolted to Him, ran between His knees, banged her head against His breast, and then bolted back, to the accompaniment of faint titters throughout the hall.\" The building became the DC Baha'i center on December 1st 1909. In 1912 the Assembly was meeting there every Friday night at eight pm. Unity Feasts were observed on the first of every month generally at the Studio, with splendid music provided courtesy of Mr. Arthur D. Mayo who was the musical director of.... He frequently brought soloists and other singers of reputation to the Feasts. They chose it because it was considered well located and commodious having a seating capacity of about 200. Now the building includes a popular Pasara Thai Restaurant and is next door to a 1904 established Pasargad Shiraz carpet business.",

Dr. John Van Schaick Jr. who gave the invocation for the April 19th session of the Orrient-Occident Unity Conference 'Abdu'l-Baha first spoke at. The Master addressed a vast gathering at the Universalist Church of more than 1,000 persons. More than an hour before the time announced, in local papers, the entire lower floor of the church was filled. The Pastor of the Church, Rev. John Van Schaick, Jr., clad in the robes of his office, introduced Abdul-Baha with a most glowing tribute to his life and teachings. Including: \"We hold with Jesus that when the Spirit of Truth is come He will guide us into all Truth. We look for more Truth in each age and every country. What you have done as a great Leader, as a Servant of God, for Universal Peace, Universal Knowledge, Universal Brotherhood, calls forth our deepest gratitude.\" At the conclusion of a brief address by the Master nearly everyone remained to meet the distinguished speaker. On His third visit to Washington the Master again addressed the congregation on November 6th at 8 o'clock. The original Church of Our Father was built in 1883, and was home to the Universalists who established themselves in 1868, and used the Church until 1925, whose architect Adolf Cluss had also designed the Eastern Market and the principle Red Smithsonian building.

His hosts were Mr. and Mrs. Arthur Jeffrey Parsons on April 21st. Mr. Parsons was an employee of the library and brought the Master to see the Rotunda by the elevator which is still in operation today. They looked down at the reading room where the Master took note of all sixteen bronze statues depicting the men renowned for their accomplishments in all principal categories of knowledge. While doing so He stated \"when one undertakes to see a thing, one should see it,\" in reply to Arthur's suggestion to move on as the time was late.  \n\nToday, you can only access a small viewing area into the Main Reading Room from the third floor where the Master made this study. As you stand there to your right will be the \"Pillar of Religion\" quoting Micah 6:8 of the Holy Bible, \"WHAT DOTH THE LORD REQUIRE OF THEE, BUT TO DO JUSTLY, AND TO LOVE MERCY, AND TO WALK HUMBLY WITH THY GOD?\" above the pillar. The figure of Moses which the Master saw will remain visible to your right, left of the religion pillar.  Out of view to the right is St. Paul. `Abdu’l-Bahá’  may also have seen the great hall honoring Islam for physics with a painting on the dome high above. Dating from 1800, the library in the form the Master saw it, had been opened to the public only a decade earlier in 1897. The Master then went to see the stalks machinery for moving books and to see some rare books from Turkey.\n\nA more recent edition to the Library, that is appropriate for a building visited by the Master, is one of the 21 remaining complete-original Gutenberg bibles, the first major book produced on a printing press with reusable-movable type anywhere in the world. Dating from 1455, the Gutenberg bible made possible, for the first time, the masses of Christian believers to become aware of the teachings of Jesus directly, by 1521 it had been translated and printed en masse in the vernacular languages. Directly, benefiting from this invention the Master had overseen the printing and publishing in Washington DC of the book \"Baha'i Proofs,\" by Mírzá Abu'l-Faḍl-i-Gulpáygání, whom He had sent to DC for this purpose in December 1901 - June 1903. It was translated by Ali Kuli Khan and published in New York in 1902 as The Bahá’í Proofs. It was for many years, until the publication of Esslemont's Bahá'u'lláh and the New Era, the standard Bahá’í textbook in America. The English translation came also to include a short treatise on the history of the Bahá’í Faith which Gulpáygání wrote while at Green Acre in 1903.",

              "Welcome to the DC Baha'i Archives, at 16th Street NW 10, where 20 items associated with the visit of 'Abdu'l-Baha to Washington DC are on display. On April 22 1912, the Washington DC archives were begun, when 'Abdu'l-Baha made the first gift to a friend in Washington, as he made throughout the course of His travels. On this day, He called the Parsons household together, where he was staying, early in the morning. He gave to the employees of the household a handmade silk handkerchief, such as those on display, after a short talk and a Blessing. He then provided Mr. Parsons an illuminated Holy Book of Baha'u'llah's done by one of the best Persian Caligraphers. Jeffrey Parsons, the son of Mrs. Parsons, received a handsome Persian inkwell. Then Mrs. Parsons received a pair of reading glasses. Later that evening, 'Abdu'l-Baha recieved a number of cables celebrating the Baha'i Holy Festival of Ridvan, and Mrs. Parsons asked to keep the cables and the Master ascended. Items like these and others, some of the believers had the foresight to keep to create the seed of this archive you are visiting. The DC archivist has set up a special presentation of these items from the Master's visit, at the 2012 DC Baha'i Center. Items on display include clothing worn by Baha'u'llah the Prophet Founder of the Baha'i Faith. The DC Bahai Archives were established by the Local Spiritual Assembly of the BahaiÕs of Washington to collect, arrange and preserve archival material, such as historical documents, records, letters, manuscripts, photographs and books. The archives provide research and reference services to Bahai institutions and to scholars and historians researching Bahai history, as well as to individuals who wish to deepen their knowledge of the Bahai Faith. The Archives holds an extensive collection of books and monographs dating from 1896 to the present, including a volume from the first World Congress of Religions in Chicago in 1893 (containing the first mention of the Baha'i faith in the United States); first editions of Baha'i scriptures in English; and many other works. Materials dating from 1896 to the present, including copies of tablets from 'Abdu'l Baha to individual believers and fledgling institutions of the Faith; copies of letters from Shoghi Effendi, Guardian of Baha'i Faith; numerous manuscripts by individual Baha'is; extensive holdings of Baha'i pamphlet literature (1910-present); and records, membership lists, correspondence, and financial and legal documents of the Spiritual Assembly of the of Washington, D.C. There is also a group of holdings called the \"Small Collections\" which feature some 200 or so Baha'is who gave exemplary service (teachers, lecturers, administrators, etc.). Some lived in Washington, others traveled through the city. The current DC Baha'i center, which houses the archives, was established in 1967.",

              "Welcome to the Hannen Residence, at 1252 8th Street NW , where 'Abdu'l-Baha gave an address on Race Unity, where the Tablets of the Divine Plan were sent from Haifa, where the first US interracial Baha'i gathering occured and where the Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory was taught the Baha'i Faith from 1907-1909. On April 23rd the Hannen's were visited by 'Abdu'l-Baha on the morn of his visit to Howard University. Pauline Hannen, who was born in Germany and whose family architected and devoutly served the Lutheran Place Memorial Church since 1873, was one of the first indivdiuals in Washington taught by a teacher sent directly to Washington by the Master, Mirza Abdu'l Fad'l. In 1902, she quickly went on to teach the Faith to her entire family, who all served the Faith in great capacity. In recognition of the incredible family Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, Pauline's Mother, raised she received a Visitation Tablet for her gravesite where the entire family is buried in Prospect Hill Cemetery. On November 10th, the Master arrived and went to rest. As He was resting He invited visitors to come to Him group by group. They came and kissed His hand and requested His assistance and blessings. Even though He was tired, each person received His kindness and blessings. He counseled them to be firm in the Cause of God and to hold fast to the mantle of love and union. Then He joined all the visitors and gave His talk on Race Unity. Three years earlier, \"on the evening of March 6th 1910, an important gathering assembled at this home of Mr. and Mrs. Hannen, representing the joining in one meeting of the European and African Descent BahaiÕs and friends of Washington. Considerable teaching work is being done among the latter. In February of 1909, Abdul-Baha had commanded that to prove the validity of Baha'i Teachings and as a means of removing existing prejudices between the races, a Spiritual Assembly or meeting be held, preferably at the home of one of the European Descent Bahais, in which both races should join. The March 6 1909 meeting is the first meeting of that character, and was to be repeated monthly. There were present about 35 persons, one-third of whom were of African Descent, and nearly all believers. It is also planned that every fourth Unity Feast, beginning April 9 1910, should be held in such manner that both races can join. This is a radical step in this section of the country, and is in reality making history,\" reported Joseph Hannen in the national Baha'i newsletter he co-authored. That April Unity Feast (what is now called 19 day feast) occured at Pauline's sister, Fanny Knobloch's house, on G Street NW. The following interracial feasts followed at 902 T St NW at the Washington Conservatory of Music owned by Harriet Gibbs Marshall. In a July 23 1909 letter, Mr. Gregory well described perhaps a typical reaction to the interracial teaching efforts of the Hannens, \"It comes to me that I have never taken occasion to thank you specifically for all your kindness and patience, which finally culminated in my acceptance of the great truths of the BahÁ'_ Revelation. It has given me an entirely new conception of Christianity and of all religion, and with it my whole nature seems changed for the better...It is a sane and practical religion, which meets all the varying needs of life, and I hope I shall ever regard it as a priceless possession.\" The Hannen's also taught the \"first of her race\" Mrs. Pocahontas Pope the Baha'i Faith, as well as Millie York, Nellie Gray, Rhonda Turner to form the entire nucleus of the First sizable Baha'i African-American community in America. Today, upon the property rises the Washington Convention Center.",

He was welcomed by music from a band while the audience applauded with excitement and exuberance. The president of the university introduced him as the Prophet of Peace and the harbinger of unity and salvation. The talk published in the promulgation of World Peace, is famous for expressing so clearly the work before all European Americans to Love, Honor and work for Mutual Advancement with those Americans of African Descent. Likewise he challenged African Descent Americans to confront their suspicions and work for mutual advancement with European Americans. The Rankin Chapel is named after the family of Howard University's 6th president who paid for the initial construction. Jeremiah Rankin courageously integrated the first Church in Washington over the objections of half the congregation who quit the Congregational church in 1869. Built in 1894, this Chapel has continued to host great leaders of America, and the Baha'is of Washington DC have been holding remembrances here every April over the past two decades in commemoration of this event. After the talk the Master took a short drive about the grounds, and you should as well go across the quad you should visit the Alain Locke buliding, named after the most famous American Philosopher to declare his belief in Baha'u'llah. He may have been in attendance at the talk in 1912, as he had begun teaching here in 1911, and declared his faith 6 years later. He was a leader of the Harlem Rennaissance, making a signal contribution to unity in diversity. He assisted the Guardian with the translation of the Gleanings of Baha'u'llah. And he contributed important treaties upon the Baha'i Faith published in Baha'i World. The Chapel's mission continues today to develop spiritually grounded leaders for America and the global community. At 11 AM you can participate in their non denominational worship service at Cramton Auditorium on campus. Baha'is in cooperation with Howard University have commemorated 'Abdu'l-Baha's historic visit over the past quarter century.",

              "Welcome to the 1912 Persian Legation at 1832 16th St, its charge d'affaires was a Baha'i, Ali Kuli Khan. The position was taken with the express permission of the Master. In 1901 the religiously tolerant Persian Minister to the United States Ishaq Khan arrived in America the same year as Mirza Abu'l-Fad'l and Khan. He had known Abu'l-Fad'l from Cairo where he had been Persia's Minister at Cairo. Not knowing english he asked Khan to serve as persian legation and also personal secreatary. A Charge d'Affaires carries on the same duties and has the same privileges as an Ambassador, and his position was renewed in 1911 by the Regent 'Adudu'l-Mulk beginning August 17, 1910. The Washington Herald, September 4, 1910, welcomed Khan to the city, The appointment of Mirza Ali-Kuli Khan as Persian charge daffaires here is another gratifying return of an old friend. He has been absent in Persia for eight months...presented his credentials as charge daffaires to Acting Secretary of State Huntington Wilson Thursday. It is here that the Master famously taught a lesson in the import of Character versus the color of skin in arranging seating, and emphasizing that segregation had no place in the future of the world. On April 23rd, Mr. Louis George Gregory was called by the Master following the talk at his alma matter, for a conference at the Persian legation. The Master had understood that no provision would be made for Mr. Gregory to participate and no other African American had been invited to this diplomatic level meal. After the conference with Mr. Gregory, the Master was called to eat, recognized that Louis was not present, He stood up dramatically and looked around and asked \"Mr. Gregory! Where is Mr. Gregory?\" in front of everyone. Mr. Khan went to seek him out. While Mr. Khan was finding Mr. Gregory, 'Abdu'l-Baha broke with contemporary social custom of racial segregation and sitting by diplomatic rank, to rearrange the seats to accommodate Mr. Gregory at his right hand in the seat of honor. He followed this up, by commenting upon the oneness of Mankind during the luncheon. The luncheon was followed by a talk to a larger gathering at the legation, which included the Turkish Ambassador in attendance, who so appreciated the talk he went on to the Parsons for the daily evening talk as well. There, he invited the Master and some friends to the Turkish embassy on Thursday. 'Abdu'l-Baha would visit with Mirza Ali Kuli Khan again on the 26th of April. In Washington 'Abdu'l-Baha met with the Turkish, Persian, British, Dutch and Swiss delegations to Washington, and Mr. Khan was no doubt instrumental in gaining the Bahai Faith a hearing in these circles of society. In November he was absent for the Master's final visit to DC on legation business in Alberta, Canada. The building itself came into the use of Ali Kuli Khan, rented from the American Treasurer General William Morgan Shuster who Mr. Khan had recommended to be appointed to manage Persia's finances at a time of tremendous Russian and British encroachment. Shuster's 1912 book \"The Strangling of Persia\" recounts the details of these events, his 15 hired assistants were all Baha'is and he resisted Persia's Finance Minister's attempts to have him fire them. Sarah Thorn had the building built in 1897, and leased it to Shuster in 1911 thru 1916. The lease to the Khans has been preserved and from it we know that the real estate agents were Moore and Hill, Inc., and that the annual rent of $1,320 began on November 1, 1910. There is another lease, signed October 24, 1911, at the same rent.",

              "The building is today has retained significant aspects of its 1912 makeup thanks to the careful maintenance of previous owners Mr. and Mrs. Boyle. They were gracious hosts of 60 the 97th commemoration. The significance of the Boyle's restoration of the building is well described by Ali Kuli Khan's description of Ali Kuli Khan's visit to the site in the 1950s, \"In extreme old age, walking through the quarter where many legations and embassies once had been, but by now was shabby and forgotten, Khan stood outside the house which bore the shamed look that old buildings seem to have, once they have come down in the world, and he moaned a little and shed tears. Probably he saw again his old ambitions and hopes, his young and promising family, the then successes, and clearest of all a day in 1912 when, at a luncheon offered Him by Florence and Khan, 'Abdu'l-Baha had honored this house with His presence.\""

              "Welcome to the Metropolitan African Methoidst Episcopal Church at 1519 M Street NW, where the Master addressed the first of two scientific societies He spoke to in Washington. The Church which established the scientific society was itself born in 1794, following the 1786 rejection by the American Methoidst General Conference that African Descent Americans can manage their own churches. This Church expanded to Washington in 1822 under Rev. David Smith. The cornerstone of the current building was laid in 1881. Seeming to foretell 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to his national church, the Bishop of the 1912 African Methodist Episcopal Church, John Hurst, wrote \"the African-American Church must play the role of keeping the fire burning on the altar until the day when men again become reverent, and that the African American's liberal interpretation of the Christian religion, based upon the brotherhood of man and the fatherhood of God, must gain ascendancy and be accepted by a regenerated world of tomorrow. The world having now gone mad after the trifles of this life, is sadly in need of a redeemer to save men from themselves. In the contest between selfishness and goodliness the former has been victor in the soul of the American and European.\" Earlier, Bishop Daniel Payne of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, founded in 1881 the Bethel Literary and Historical Association (Bethel means House of God). This literary societies represented one of the tangible signs of the evolution and solidification of black educational opportunities and improvement in the lot of black people despite the difficult circumstances they faced. Bishop Payne, intended this to be a forum in which \"maturity of thought, breadth of comprehension, sound scholarship, lofty patriotism and exalted philanthropy could find a cordial welcome, and where the widest reasonable latitude could be given to the expression of thought.\" In a description of its meetings it was said that \"no higher average of the competence, intelligence and culture of the American Negro could have been found elsewhere under the broad canopy of heaven than was assembled there.\" Robert J. Smith became the first president in 1881. In that year the society held weekly meetings, with its 75 members. The first ever discussion: \"Who were the Ancient Egyptians and what did they accomplish?\" was given by Reverend A.W. Upshaw, graduate of the Howard University Theology Department. The issue of race continued to be a prominent theme continuing into its third year 1883, Charles J. Gardiner, principal of Adelphi Academy of Brooklyn NY, came to read a paper called \"The Race Problem in the United States.\" This tradition of excellence continued under the leadership of Mary Church Terrell. The daughter of two enslaved Africans, she was among the first women of African descent to complete a college education in 1884. She went on to become the founder and first president of the National Association of Colored Women. The line of distinguished presidents continued with Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory in 1909. In order to share his new priceless possession with others, Louis Gregory explained, he hoped to arrange a large scale Bahai meeting, which as many as fifteen hundred people might be expected to attend. It would be held in the fall of 1909 under the auspices of the Bethel Literary and Historical Association. He thus began giving a series of talks on the Bahai Faith to that august institution in Washington, D.C.:",

During His visits to Washington, He traveled often in the Parson's horse drawn carriage or Mrs. Hemmick's automobile. However, He frequently walked when given a chance.\nOf the numerous walks He undertook in Washington, none of the routes were known as specifically as this one. The Master took the 0.8 mile walk with Dr. Fareed, Mr. Remey and Mrs. Parsons who were all headed to Mrs. Parson's recently deceased dear mother's gravesite together. On this walk, He saw a motor car pass, and He discussed it then asked for its price. As no one knew, none having bought one, He asked Mr. Remey to find out the price. Mr. Remey ran towards the car to find out. Dr. Fareed explained to Mr. Remey, to find out at some later point in a humorous tone.\nHowever safety was no laughing matter. As rotating, hand-operated stop & go signs were in operation at intersections like that of 14th Street and Pennsylvania Avenue, cars remained very dangerous. Mrs. Parsons (1934), Mr. Hannen (1920), and Mrs. Charlotte Brittingham Dixon (1939) were amongst other early DC believers who lost their lives by being struck by automobiles. \nAlthough there has been much construction on 18th Street since then, a few of the buildings the Master saw can still be observed, including 1704 thru 900 18th Street NW.",

Here, the Master visited the gravesite of the parents of Mrs. Agnes Parsons, which lie northeast of the intersection of Meigs and McPherson Drive.\nOn April 24th at noon, the Master arrived with Mrs. Parsons, Mr. Remey and Dr. Fareed. They began by visiting the home of Robert E. Lee and his family and walking through some of the rooms. George Washington Parke Custis, grandson of Martha Washington and adopted son of George Washington built Arlington House. Enslaved Africans and hired craftsmen constructed the house in stages from 1802-1818 on a high bluff surrounded by a forest of oaks and a 1,100 acre plantation. The Greek Revival design features a two-story central section framed by a Doric columned portico, and flanked north and south by lower wings. As a young boy, Custis had lived at Mount Vernon after the death of his father. As an adult, Custis wanted his home to be a living memorial to the President. Afterwards, the Master enjoyed the flowers in a garden which is still maintained to this day. He enjoyed splendid views of the Capitol and Library of Congress which He would later visit. \nThe Master then proceeded to the graves of General William B. and Mrs. Agnes Royall. He chanted a Tablet and placed white roses upon the graves. He learned General John Haskell King, Mrs. Parsons' father's best friend was also buried nearby and the Master placed one white rose at the General John Haskell King's Grave as well. Dr. Fareed took down a long tablet the Master recited as the Master placed the white roses in flower receptacles on either side of the gravestone of Mrs. Parsons's mother and father. \nMrs. Parsons was brought up as the first generation of military children who lived in remote bases with their families. In that position, she was witness not only to the terror of the genocide against the First Nations of America but also the great heroism of Ponca Chief Standing Bear in May 1879 where at Fort Omaha he explained, \"What have I done? I am brought here, but what have I done? I don't know. It seems as though I haven't a place in the world, no place to go, and no home to go to.\" Federal Judge Elmer Dundy was moved to rule, \"During the fifteen years in which I have been engaged in administering the laws of my country, I have never been called upon to hear or decide a case that appealed so strongly to my sympathy as the one now under consideration. On the one side we have a few of the remnants of a once numerous and powerful, but now weak, insignificant, unlettered, and generally despised race. On the other, we have the representative of one of the most powerful, most enlightened, and most Christianized nation of modern times.. It may seem beyond belief that, in the one hundred third year of the declaration, 'all men are created equal,' it was necessary for a Federal Judge to determine at great length that every human being is a person, and as such entitled to a hearing in the courts.\" Mrs. Parsons was also able to witness the Buffalo soldiers at Fort Huachuca, showing her the high station and able capacities of the Americans of African Descent first hand. Mrs. Agnes Parsons provided a great service in keeping a detailed diary of the 1912 visit of the Master to Washington including to the Arlington Cemetery.",

Dyer at 1937 13th Street, where 'Abdu'l-Bahá addressed the largest weekly Bahá'í gathering of African and European Descent Americans in the nation, on April 24th. On Wednesday evening, more than 100 persons were present and were made happy by his address. Mr. Dyer's birth in 1847 places him in the Maafa era of enslavement in America, which must have provided a special gravitas to the gatherings, as the elder of the community. \n'Abdu'l-Bahá left the meeting so happy He proclaimed loudly so people on the street could hear Him, \"O Bahá’u’lláh! What hast Thou done? O Bahá’u’lláh! May My life be sacrificed for Thee! O Bahá’u’lláh! May My soul be offered up for Thy sake! How full were Thy days with trials and tribulations! How severe the ordeals Thou didst endure! How solid the foundation Thou has finally laid, and how glorious the banner Thou didst hoist!”. \nThe Wednesday meetings at the Dyer home were centrally located in one of the most prosperous African American communities in the nation. This led to the likes of Mrs. Coralie Franklin Cook, a high society woman serving on the Washington DC Board of Education, to become attracted to the Faith. \nOn one occasion, Mrs. Hannen and her sister Miss Fanny Knobloch were speaking with the Master and told him that the Wednesday night meetings were studying the Book of Certitude. He responded, \"Very good ! Very good! It is very good to memorize the logical points and the proofs of the Holy Books. Those proofs and evidences which establish the fact that Bahá’u’lláh is the fulfillment of the Promises of the Holy Books. These proofs ought to be collected and memorized. As soon as someone will ask you --What are your proofs?-- you may cry out at the top of your voice and say: 'Here they are!'\".\nOn another occasion on June 17 1910, Mr. Hippolyte Dreyfus gave a talk to the gathering, as would other guest speakers who would come to town, and might have stayed at the Bahá'í Hospice set up to host such individuals. \nAnd still on another occasion this weekly event was chosen to throw a surprise party for the African Descent Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory. Many fellow Bahá'ís in Washington, well aware that Louis Gregory was the first African Descent American to have the privilege and opportunity of pilgrimage at the express invitation of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, shared his excitement. On 22 March Mr. and Mrs. Andrew J. Dyers regular Wednesday Bahá'í­ meeting became a surprise farewell party, attended by more than fifty Bahá'ís and guests. Even though the Wednesday meetings were primarily for African Descent Americans, on this occasion a number of European Descent Bahá'ís participated. Joseph Hannen wrote of the evening in Star of the West, “Mr. Gregory was given the seat of honor, at the head of the long table, and his chair was surmounted by a horse-shoe of flowers. While refreshments were being served, speeches were made by a number, including Dr. W. B. Evans, Principal of the Armstrong Manual Training School; Miss Grace Robarts; Mrs .Claudia S. Coles; Mr. Charles Mason Remey; Professor Stanwood Cobb; Mr. and Mrs. Hannen. Mr. Gregory responded in a feeling manner to the good wishes expressed. The importance to Louis Gregory of his first overseas voyage cannot be exaggerated. Even as a pleasure trip, it would have been a milestone in his life. He crossed in freedom the ocean that his Grandmother (who he knew well) had traversed in chains. Moreover, he landed on the African continent with a new ethnic awareness. Having been recognized as an American on sight by fellow passengers from other countries, he concluded that Americans of African Descent had made a unique adaptation to America precisely because their ties with Africa had been so ruthlessly cut, and in fact no other American group . . . is more American.” (To Move the World, by Gayle Morrison, pp. 41-43). \nWhile the building no longer stands, there are row houses built in the same 1900’s style just south of the corner. If you walk three blocks east to 10th and U Streets, you will come to the African American Civil War Memorial, which honors the \"Bahá'í Unit\", the 104th United States Colored Troop Unit from South Carolina in which both Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory's Father (Sgt. George Gregory) and the first American Bahá'í Thorton Chase (Capt. William B Chase) appear on the Memorial, honored for their service in the Civil War. On April 23rd at Howard University, the Master said of their service, \"How they fought and sacrificed until they freed the [African Descent Americans]!\"",

There,'Alí-Kuli Khán, who translated for the Master, related the history of the Faith at Mr. Bell's request. Then Mr. Bell thanked the Master for coming to his home and asked Him to address the guests. The Master began His talk by praising their good manners and praiseworthy qualities. He then spoke of the importance and results of science, the greatness of this age and the interdependence of society, and paid a glorious tribute to the new Dispensation. After the talk the Master spoke through Mr. Bell to his wife and daughter via sign language. \nMr. Bell had another tie to the Faith. His telephone associate Moses Gerrish Farmer's (a former telegraph parts manufacturer in Boston) daughter Sarah Jane Farmer was one of the most famous Bahá'ís in America having founded Green Acre, a Bahá'í School in Maine. There, in 1904, she hosted a program dedicated to the resolution of the Russo-Japanese war. The following year when President Roosevelt won the Nobel Peace Prize for helping to negotiate an end to the war within site of Green Acre, Ms. Farmer was the only women to obtain a pass to the ceremonial signing of the Treaty. \nBell and his wife Mabel Hubbard, who had been deaf from early childhood, moved to Washington, DC, in 1879. The following year, the French government awarded Bell the Volta Prize of 50,000 francs for the invention of the telephone. Bell used the money to found Volta Associates, which was focused on the research of recording and transmitting sound. In 1887, the Volta Associates sold the record patents they had developed at the laboratory to the American Gramophone Company, and Bell took part of his share of the profits to found the Volta Bureau as an instrument \"for the increase and diffusion of knowledge relating to the Deaf.\" The Bureau, which was first housed at Bell's father's house at 1527 35th Street, worked in close cooperation with the American Association for the Promotion of the Teaching of Speech to the Deaf (known since 1956 as the Alexander Graham Bell Association for the Deaf), organized in 1890, of which Bell was elected President. The Volta Bureau officially merged with this Association in 1908. The work of the Bureau increased to such a volume that in 1893 Bell constructed a neoclassic yellow brick and sandstone building to specifically house the institution at 1537 35th Street. Bell constructed the building across the street from his father's house, the first headquarters of the Bureau. The Master went to what was at the time 1331 Connecticut Avenue, but was later updated to the current street number, to 1355 Connecticut Avenue before it was demolished in 1937.",

              "Welcome to the residence of Mrs. Pocahontas Pope, at 1500 1st Street, the home of the \"first believer\" of her race.\nOn November 6th at 3pm, the Master went on a carriage ride with Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Brown of California, and went to visit a \"colored\" woman who was ill, who may have been Mrs. Pocahontas Pope. Two days later, on November 8th, the Master had a visit with a \"colored\" clergyman. Mrs. Pocahontas Pope's husband John W. Pope was a DC clergyman, and Hand of the Cause Mr. Louis George Gregory noted that he was a friend of the faith. While no record of whom was visited has been found at this time, the Master and the Faith in Washington holds a great connection to Mrs. Pocahontas Pope, so a couple of visits to her would not have been surprising. \nMrs. Pocahontas Pope became in 1906 the first member of the Bahá'í Faith of African Descent in Washington DC, and thereafter began hosting the first gatherings to teach city residents of African Descent in her home which grew into the first integrated African and European Descent Bahá'í Community in America. The Hannen's began teaching her the Cause in their home on O Street as she worked as a Seamstress in their home. \nSix years prior to His visit, the Master had written to Mrs. Pope, saying, \"Render thanks to the Lord that among that race thou art the first believer, arisen to guide others. It is my hope that through the bounties and favours of the Abhá Beauty thy countenance may be illumined, thy disposition pleasing, and thy fragrance diffused, that thine eyes may be seeing, thine ears attentive, thy tongue eloquent, thy heart filled with supreme glad-tidings, and thy soul refreshed by divine fragrances, so that thou mayest arise among that race and occupy thyself with the edification of the people, and become filled with light. Although the pupil of the eye is black, it is the source of light. Thou shalt likewise be. The disposition should be bright, not the appearance. Therefore, with supreme confidence and certitude, say: 'O God! Make me a radiant light, a shining lamp, and a brilliant star, so that I may illumine the hearts with an effulgent ray from Thy Kingdom of Abhá.’\"\nHer entering the community represented the fourth phase of growth in the DC Bahá’í Community. First, there was the founder Charlotte Brittingham Dixon and the seven she taught. Then there was the Paris group. Then there was the teacher sent by 'Abdu'l-Bahá, Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl who taught Pauline Hannen, who in turn understood that she was to teach those of African Descent as well. She began by teaching her employees, Mrs. Pocahontas Pope and Mrs. Rhoda Turner (424 S. St NW), but the follow up work was done by her sister, Ms. Alma Knobloch and her mother Mrs. Amalie Knobloch who both went to Mrs. Pope's home and there met others like Mrs. York and Mrs. Grey. Mrs. Lua Getsinger spoke several times at Mrs. Pope's home. Mírzá 'Alí-Kuli Khán, Mr. Howard McNutt and Mr. Hooper Harris spoke in Mrs. Turner's home. Mr. Hooper Harris also spoke at Mrs. Pope's home at 12 N St. NW, her address in 1906. Mr. Joseph Hannen also spoke several times at Mrs. Pope's house. At all these meetings there were 20 to 40 people of African Descent present. According to Professor Christopher Buck, Alan A. Anderson, whose child 'Abdu'l-Bahá named Mobarek on the 23rd of April 1912 at the Parsons home, was the first to declare his faith after Pocahontas.\nBy 1908 the DC community included fifteen Americans of African Descent. Next, the Hannen's themselves began hosting integrated meetings in their home, where Mr. Gregory began studying the Faith, himself declaring his Faith in July 1909, with Mrs. Grey, Mrs. York, and Mrs. Getsinger there for his introductory first meeting. 'Abdu'l-Bahá had instructed the DC community to integrate meetings beginning in March of 1910, at the Hannen home and at the Dyer home. This then expanded to all meetings under the direct instruction of the Master. Making DC, the first racially integrated Bahá'í Community in North America. This permitted, by the end of the Master's visit, one of the foremost National African Descent newspapers, the 'Washington Bee' to report from Washington, that the Bahá'í Faith's \"white devotees, even in this prejudice-ridden community, refuse to draw the color line. The informal meetings, held frequently in the fashionable mansions of the cultured society in Sheridan Circle [Barney], Dupont Circle [Parsons], Connecticut [Bahá’í center] and Massachusetts [Khán] avenues, have been open to Negroes on terms of absolute equality.”\nThanks to the great archival work of Ms. Paula Bidwell, we know that Pocahontas Pope was born in 1864 in Halifax County, North Carolina to Mr. and Mrs. Mary Cha Kay. Her brothers and sisters were Walter, Willey and Roxanor. John W. Pope had been born in Halifax County in 1857. His family was known to worship at the Pleasant Plains Baptist Church and Willow Oak African Methodist Episcopal churches in North Carolina. She was married in the early 1880s to Pastor John W. Pope and they moved to Washington DC from North Carolina by 1900, leaving behind the 1899 European Supremist Jim Crow laws which were introduced that year in North Carolina. They began boarding at the home of Frank Allen at 1127 24th street, with Mr. Pope working as a clerk in much sought after government positions. \nThey moved into their own home at 12 N Street NW where they hosted the initial Bahá'í gatherings. By 1910, they moved down the street to 142 N Street NW. In 1912, they were living at 1500 First Street NW where they stayed until 1930. Mr. Pope passed away on the 30th of March 1918. Relatives of Mr. Pope who comforted Mrs. Pocahontas Pope at the funeral included Mrs. Lizzie Pope and Rev. Cicero Pope of Raleigh, North Carolina, and Dr. Manassas T. Pope, a Shaw University medical graduate and North Carolina's first licensed physician of African descent. Their mutual grandfather was Jonas Elias Pope (1827-1913), a carpenter who owned a significant amount of land, was a Quaker and came from a family liberated from enslavement since the late 1700s. Mr. Jonas Pope had seven children from 1832 to 1841. Dr. Pope is unique among only 7 men in Raleigh, being able to bypass the voter disenfranchisement of 1900 requiring that your grandfather voted (excluding all formerly enslaved peoples), but Dr. Pope could claim this past. He even ran for mayor of Raleigh in 1919. The \"Pope House\" in Raleigh is now a nationally registered historic site and is being transformed into a Museum. \nMrs. Pocahontas Pope's birthplace of Halifax County has been since at least 1730 has been home to the Saponi, Nansemond, Tuscarora, Occaneechi, Tutelo, and Gingaskin First Nations, known collectively as the Haliwa-Saponi Tribe. Kay family oral history speaks of First Nation ancestry. In the 1700s, the number of Native Americans enslaved in areas such as the Carolinas may have been as much as half of the African slave population. In addition to working together in the fields, they lived together in communal living quarters, and ultimately united in marriage. So her description by 'Abdu'l-Baha as the \"first of her race\" might be a reference to her First Nations heritage. The first African Descent believer is Mr. Robert Turner, seven years prior, who was also well known to the Master.",

              "Welcome to the New Willard Hotel, Washington's first skyscraper, at 1401 Pennsylvania Avenue. Here, the Master and Mrs. Parsons bid farewell to Mrs. Ramona Allen Brown of California, with whom 'Abdu'l-Bahá was traveling on November 6th in Mrs. Parsons carriage.\nMrs. Brown traveled as far as Washington with the Master following His trip to California and would later record it in a manner largely unmatched by others for its vividness. Through her words, you can gain a new sense of His daily actions, how believers would introduce their families to Him and what sorts of questions were asked of Him.\nHer father, Dr. Woodson Allen, was born in 1854 in Greensburg, Kentucky. He had married Frances Emma Orr in 1884 in Junction City, Kansas. In 1887 they gave birth to her brother, Dr. Warren B. Allen. Ramona Allen Brown was then born in Boulder Creek, California, on August 10, 1889. She first heard about the Bahá’í Faith in 1904 at the age of fifteen and immediately embraced the religion. 'Abdu'l-Bahá's visit to California in 1912 only deepened her commitment to the Faith. \nExcept for a short trip to Hawaii, Mrs. Brown remained in California, raising her family and teaching the Bahá’í Faith, until 1954. In that year, she made a pilgrimage to the World Center of the Bahá’í­ Faith, then moved to Majorca and later settled in Austria. In 1963, poor health forced her to return to California, where she lived in La Jolla until her death on February 23, 1975, at the age of eighty-six.\nShe continued to share her memories of the beloved Master to the end of her life. Her best known work is entitled \"Memories of 'Abdu'l-Bahá: recollections of the early days of the Bahá’í Faith in California.\" In the book, she describes her feelings on November 6th after having spent the day with the Master, “When 'Abdu'l-Bahá had finished speaking my heart was filled with happiness and warm love for Him. We departed with the lingering memory of the Masters words, spoken in His soft, beautiful voice, so kindly uttering His instructions to us.”",

              "Welcome to the home of Mrs. Florence Breed Khán and Mr. 'Alí-Kuli Khán, which stood where the parking lot is now at 1913 Massachusetts Ave. Here the Master visited the couple, who represented the first fruit of the spiritual union of east and west, several times in April.\nAt noon on April 20th, the couple and their children were attempting to have lunch and, like the other Washington Bahá'ís, were wondering when 'Abdu'l-Bahá would arrive in the capital. Suddenly there came a phone call from Mr. Mason Remey: 'Hurry! The Master is arriving at the station in half an hour!' They dropped their forks and knives, collected their children Rahím and Marzieh, and ran out into the street, breathless, trying to catch a transport which could reach the station on time. With fervent prayers, and urging short cuts on the driver, they made it five minutes before the train pulled in. Florence rushed to the florist's in the station and bought two bouquets for the children to present, violets for Rahím and red roses for Marzieh. Thus began a wonderful reunion with the Master for the happy family.\nOn April 25th, the Master motored to the Khán home with Mrs. Hallie Davis Elkins. Later Mr. and Mrs. Parsons picked up the Master from the Kháns in their horse-drawn carriage. He visited again on the 26th of April. \nThe couple's marriage, the first interracial marriage amongst the Bahá'ís of America, took place in 1905 in a suburb of Boston at the home of a Reverend Smith. The two cabled the Master and were told that, on hearing this news, 'Abdu'l-Bahá clapped His hands and sent for sweets, shared the word with the pilgrims, and celebrated with them this first fulfillment of Bahá'u'lláh’s prophecy, that the day would come when east and west would embrace like unto two lovers. He blessed their marriage with a remarkable wedding Tablet, wishing them a life of achievement in both the material and the spiritual worlds. Florence later gave birth to Rahím Khán, and when news reached the Master, He revealed another Tablet calling the child the first fruits of the spiritual union between east and west. The following year during a very eventful pilgrimage to Akka, the Master had dictated a Tablet for Florence as well, saying, 'Verily I am pleased with thee,' and giving her the name Rúhíyyih (‘spiritual’). On their elder child, Rahím He further bestowed the name ‘Abdu’l-Husayn, servant of Baha'u'llah. Florence recalled of the event “His bounty was beyond belief towards me, and I could only hope I may please Him, by future  work.”\nBorn in Boston, Florence Breed had family connections, was raised by brilliant parents, attended a Boston finishing school, met celebrities in her mother’s home, become familiar with the culture of the Continent as well as Turkey and Greece and spoke excellent French. She chose the dramatic stage instead of being a married society women, as was most common amongst her class. With the death of one of her boyfriends, Philip Savage, she turned to spiritual studies and left the East Coast for Chicago. She investigated the New Thought movement. She studied Christian Science and some of the members of that sect felt that she could become a healer. She took up Yogi breathing and levitated, or thought she did, a block. During her spiritual quest in Chicago, Florence lived in a house of eccentric people organized by a Mrs. Ford where all were fined a penny if they spoke ill of the absent. Florence, following Mrs. Ford’s spiritual searchings, attended her first Bahá’í study class in Chicago in 1902.\nIn 1903, Mrs. Ford went to the Green Acre School in Elliot, Maine where she met 'Alí-Kuli Khán and Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and reported this news back to Florence. Back in Boston in the fall of 1903, Florence was studying the Hidden Words, given to her by Mrs. Ford. Florence soon became and remained a dedicated believer from 1903. 'Abdu'l-Bahá later said of Florence, “She is a true believer”. She was also given a Persian State Title as Muravvihus-Saltanih (‘Who Gives the Kingdom Life’), in recognition of her services to Persia, a distinction never before been conferred on a foreign woman.\nForty years later, Shoghi Effendi, the leader of the Faith, honored her upon her passing on June 27, 1950, “Profoundly grieve at passing of beloved, distinguished, staunch, great-hearted handmaid of beloved Master. Praying fervently for progress of her soul in Kingdom. Her reward assured. Loving sympathy.” 'Alí-Kuli Khán, also known as Nabílu'd-Dawlih, was an eminent Iranian Bahá'í. He was born in Káshán (Persia) about 1879 where his father was the mayor. About 1898, he became a Bahá'í and served briefly as 'Abdu'l-Bahá's English-language secretary (1899-1901) and was subsequently sent to America where he translated several Bahá'í books into English as well as continuing to translate 'Abdu'l-Bahá's correspondence with the American Bahá'ís and to act as a teacher. He was appointed Iranian charge d'affaires in Washington in 1910 and later served in various high-ranking diplomatic posts, becoming Head of the Court of the Crown Prince Regent and ever maintaining a passion for linking together Persia and America. He married the American Florence Breed (1875-1950) in 1904, praised by 'Abdu'l-Bahá for being the first marriage between an Eastern and Western Bahá’í, and served the Faith for almost seventy years until his death in Washington, DC on April 7th, 1966. Their daughter, Marzieh Gail (1908-93), also became an eminent Bahá'í translator.",

              "Welcome to Turkish Embassy, which stood at 1711 Connecticut Avenue, where the Master was welcomed as a guest four times, only a few years after his imprisonment by Ottoman Empire had ended.\nIt was here, on April 25th, where the Ambassador Ziya Pasha hosted the Master for a memorable dinner. The groundwork for the diner was laid far in advance by Mrs. Florence Khán and Mr. 'Alí-Kuli Khán. As a good will gesture toward Turkey, Mrs. Florence Khán had earlier arranged a dinner honoring the Turkish Ambassador, Ziya Pasha, and told him of the Master's forthcoming visit. Before dinner was over the Ambassador requested Florence and Khán to ask 'your illustrious friend' to dine one night at the Turkish Embassy, and asked Florence to send him a guest list of some Bahá'í friends of 'Abdu'l-Bahá in the capital.\nUpon arrival to Washington, the Master accepted this invitation, and the Kháns had the honor of escorting Him to the dinner a few days later. Two gigantic powdered footmen in livery opened the Embassy doors to them, and the Master greeted them kindly in Turkish. At table, Florence found herself on the Master's right, He sitting opposite the Ambassador, across the width of the table. Ziya Pasha was beaming. He read a prepared statement, \"The light of His honor's quality and knowledge in this new land ... He has suffered and sacrificed everything for the purpose of disseminating good qualities for humanity. His Honor, 'Abdu'l-Bahá, is unique in our age and is highly esteemed and treasured by all of us. With prayer to the Lord of the worlds, I wish Him a long life and good health.\"\nFlorence spoke a little to 'Abdu'l-Bahá in praise of the Bahá'í women of Persia. 'Such humility of spirit,' she said, 'such a great self-sacrificing love. I think they are really the most wonderful women in the world. Do you not consider them the best women on earth?' she persisted. 'The women of Persia are indeed very kind,' He said. The Master gave a brief talk, interpreted by 'Alí-Kuli Khán, in which He referred to Kipling's statement so often repeated (even today) by westerners, 'East is East, and West is West and never the twain shall meet.' And He pointed smilingly to Florence and 'Alí-Kuli and to the Ambassador's beautiful daughter-in-law from Virginia. 'The East and West have already met,' He said, 'apparently with happy results, and in future these unions will increase.'\nFollowing this evening Ziya Pasha 'became really enamored' of 'Abdu'l-Bahá and called upon Him day after day and attended certain of His talks. Often, when He was driving about the city, 'Abdu'l-Bahá took the Ambassador along with Him. The Master made it back to the Embassy on the 26th and 28th of April and on the morning of November 7th when He had a long visit with the Ambassador.\nReflecting upon this evening Florence Khán later wrote, \"Looking back, we see how, in symbol, the two realms that had brutally persecuted this Faith in its early days and tried to extinguish it forever, now showed the Master homage: both the Persian Legation and the Turkish Embassy (legally, even in America, the countries themselves), opened their doors to the one-time prisoner. We remember, too, how much malevolence had been directed toward Bahá'u'lláh from the Persian Embassy at Constantinople, which ultimately for a time was to be headed by Khán, a Bahá'í, and where Bahá'ís such as Jináb-i-Fádil-i-Mázindarání, a noted Bahai historian who lectured in the United States, would be received with honor. Again, the last member of the Qájár Dynasty, a dynasty which had sent thousands of Bahá'ís to their death, would be hosted by Khán at this same Embassy in Constantinople and would come to rely heavily on this follower of Bahá'u'lláh.\"\nYusuf Ziya Pasha (1849-1929) was a statesman, composer and diplomat who oversaw the creation of the Turkey's first music school. At the time of the visit, he was the Ambassador of the Ottoman Empire to America.",

His first visit came after a five block morning walk with His entourage for a visit on the 26th of April from the Parson's home, and spoke to a few people at the home. The Master visited again on the 28th of April, this time being driven with his entourage. In the evening of May 9th on his way from the Parsons home to His 1336 apartment he visited Mrs. White again. Finally, on November 6th she was visited by the Master for the final time. Mrs. Grace Hoffman White, was a great leader in the women's suffrage movement and the women-led peace movement which both took great strides forward in 1912 and 1913. She chose the purple, white and gold colors of the Congressional Union which launched systematic national lobbying efforts of Congress in 1912. The Congressional Union described itself as \" a group of women in all parts of the country who have joined together in the effort to secure the passage of an Amendment to the United States Constitution enfranchising women. They did the hard work to have Suffrage debated in Congress for the first time since 1887.\" She also made use of her writing talents, in being the art editor for the National Suffrage Edition of the San Francisco Bulletin, edited by Mrs. O. H. P. Belmont, with Alice Paul as telegraph editor. As hard working as she was for suffrage she was also elected to the inaugural leadership of the Women's Peace Party in 1915, also in Washington. The 3,000 women who elected her also approved a platform calling for the extension of suffrage to women to make decisions upon peace and for a conference of neutral countries to offer continuous mediation as a way of ending war. Later, to influence a more peaceful resolution to the Great War in 1919, she joined forces with an African Descent women Mary Church Terrell and represented America at the 2nd International Congress of the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom (which remains in existence to this day) in Zurich Switzerland in 1919. The WILPF envisions a world free of violence, poverty, pollution and dominance. WILPF stands for equality of all people in a world free of racism, sexism and homophobia; the building of a constructive peace through world disarmament; and the changing of government priorities to meet human needs. In 1921, she participated in the \"Women Advocates of Peace\" Convention in Washington. On July 21 1934, Mrs. Grace Hoffman White, then the Connecticut state chairman of the National Woman's Party, announced \"The past year has been an important one for women. The first treaty giving complete equality to women in the history of the world was signed at Montevideo in December 1933, and ratified by the United States on May 24, 1934. The National Woman's Party is directly responsible for this epoch-making treaty and with the prestige derived from it, we can have the Equal Rights Ammendment, passed by the next Congress.\" Which provides that \"men and women shall have qual rights in the United States of America and in every place subject to its jurisdiction.\" She also was supportive of the First Nations of America, by donating permanently her late husbands cultural objects he had collected to the Museum of the American Indian in 1925. Like the Khan's she is familiar with the Hearst family, with her Goddaughter married to Mr. Norman Hapgood, the editor of Hearst International. The building was constructed in 1875, and was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1991. When the home was built Dupont circle was known as \"Pacific Circle,\" until 1884's construction of the Admiral DuPont statue. Behind the house you will see a gigantic purple wisteria vine which was seen by the Master, as it was planted in 1880. The Washington Post described the mansion's long gallery over the carriage way as probably the largest and best-fitted room for a library of any private dwelling in the city when newly-appointed U.S. Supreme Court Justice Edward Douglass White rented the home in 1894. In February 1899 the New York Times did a feature story on the home. \"\"The centre of the Northwest section of Washington. It stands on the south side of the street, a three-story brick of liberal width, terraced above the sidewalk by a change of grade since the building was put up, and given an appearance of greater elevation by a short flight of steps. This stairway leads to a double door in the middle of the front, opening upon a central hall. At the right of the hall, extending from front to rear of the house, is a saloon drawing room, of generous width and height. Two open fireplaces suggest a means of Winter comfort, and at the rear opening the logs blaze every afternoon.\" The home was sold to New Yorkers John and Grace Hoffman White in 1908. The Whites extensively modernized both the exterior and interior of the home. The decor reflected Mr. Whites interest in exotic animals and birds, such as those depicted by noted muralist Albert Herter on the painted wall canvasses in the drawing room. John White used the room above the carriageway to display artifacts and big game trophies. Grace Hoffman White, a suffragist, peace activist, and writer, decorated some of the homes furnishings with poetic sentiments including the music room mantel engraved with the words: I can not warm you if your heart be cold. The Whites sold the home in 1922.",

              "Welcome to the All Souls Church, at 1500 Harvard St, where the congregation now resides which 'Abdu'l-Baha spoke to in his April visit to Washington. On April 26th, a Friday morning, the Master addressed a large audience of the Woman's Alliance, which was formed in 1890 to give voice and support to issues of concern to women. The subject was \"light\". \"The effulgence of the Sun of Reality in its original essence, and of the waiting souls with pure hearts who are like unto clear spotless mirrors, whose eyes and ears become englihtened by the apeparance fo the Sun of Reality.\" Mrs. Marzieh Moss took stenographic notes, which have not yet been published. The Church founded in 1815 as a Georgetown Unitarian Society, with John Quincy Adams, John C. Calhoun amongst its founding members. In 1877 the Congregation moved to the 14th and L Street location where the Master spoke. Significantly, Fanny Bowditch Dixwell Holmes, having heard the talk on Friday morning could have told her husband Chief Justice Holmes and the friend who appointed him, President Theodore Roosevelt, to the Supreme Court to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha at the Parsons home on the 27th of April. Dr. Ulysses G. B. Pierce, minister of All Souls' Church in Washington officated the funeral of both the Holmes. President Roosevelt statement at the funeral of Chief Justice Holmes, the \"Nation has lost one of its first citiznes.\" This will be studied further in the future to explain their significant meeting with the Master. Its present church bell was cast by the son of Paul Revere and was sounded upon the death of abolitionist John Brown in 1861, whereupon, the city voted to stop using the church's bell for official city uses, such was the outrage at this action. Rev. Ulysses G. B. Pierce was given a unanimous call on April 11, 1901 as Minister of All Souls church. Dr. Pierce was born July 17, 1865 in Providence, Rhode Island, and was steeped in the tolerant tradition of Roger Williams. Though only thirty-six years old at the time of his call to Washington, he had already demonstrated exceptional gifts of mind and heart and we well fitted for the greatly increased responsibilities of the Church in the Nations Capital. 'Abdu'l-Baha's visit to the church coincided with what their church historians term their \"Era of Advance,\" from 1900 to 1924. A beautiful statement sums up the church's position on the Baha'i Faith at this time: This Church is dedicated to religion, but not to a creed. Neither upon itself nor upon its members does it impose a test of doctrinal formulas. Love to God and man and the perfecting of our spiritual nature it regards as the unchanging substance of religion and the essential gospel of Jesus. Consecrating itself to these principles, it aims at cultivating reverence for truth, moral character and insight, helpfulness to humanity and the spirit of communion with the Infinite. It welcomes to its worship and fellowship all who are in sympathy with a religion thus simple and thus free. Clearly Rev. Pierce who penned this statement, helped the congregation experience a unity of the spirit. He was a liberal Christian in the perfect meaning of that definition. He made his Church a beacon light of liberal faith. At the time of 'Abdu'l-Baha's April 26th, visit to All Souls, there was a special interest in All Souls, due to the regular presence of President William Howard Taft. The election to the Presidency in 1909 of William Howard Taft, ever a loyal, church-going Unitarian. This also provided Rev. Pierce the opportunity from 1909-1913 to be the Chaplain of the Senate.",

              "The building is no more. The church's rapid growth under the long ministry of Rev. Ulysses G. Pierce (1901-1943) required the construction of a new church at 16th and Harvard Streets NW, completed in 1923 and inspired by St. Martin-in-the-Fields Church of Trafalgar Square, London. The present edifice was completed in 1924 as national church of the Unitarian denomination."

On Friday evening, April 26th, the Continental Hall of the Daughters of the American Revolution heard the Master's last public April address. This is one of the most spacious halls in Washington, and the very finest location possible. It had not been contemplated to have such a large meeting that evening, but the interest became so intense that it was deemed necessary. Prior to the talk Mr. Samuel Gompers, founder and president of the American Federation of Labor, was brought to meet him. At 8:45 pm the chairman of the meeting, Mr. Hoover from New york, introduced the Master most eloquently. When 'Abdu'l-Baha came to the pulpit, He was received with a standing ovation and a burst of enthusiasm. As the Master arose to give His talk, everyone began to clap so loudly taht the sound echoed around the great hall. Everyone was thrilled as the beloved Master stood and the hearts of the belivers were relieved of all grief and anxiety. Then, with a motion of His hand, all seated themselves. 'Abdu'l-Baha began by saying: \"One of the teachings of Baha'u'llah is equality of rights for men and women. When He promulgated this principle in the Orient, the people were astonished. One of the proofs of the advancement of women is this magnificent and imposing building and this large gathering.” 'Abdu'l-Baha's talk centered on the subject of equality of men and women and the necessity of giving women the same training as men. Many praised Him, both before and after His talk. The meeting closed witha song of praise. After the talk He met with Daughters of the American Revolution President General Mrs. Julia Green Scott who had a few words with him. Mrs. Scott a descendent of President George Washington aside from being president of the DAR since 1909, managed 9,000 acres of farmland in Illinois and Indiana as well as being the principal stockholder, and eventually president, of the McLean County Coal Company. The DAR was founded in 1890 as a healing gesture after the Civil War. It was incorporated by Congress in 1896. Julia's sister Letitia Green Stevenson was a founding member and third president, as well. During Julia's tenure in office, Memorial Continental Hall was dedicated as the N.S.D.A.R. headquarters in Washington, D.C. in 1910. The most prominent feature of the structure is a colonnade of thirteen pillars on the front which represent the thirteen original colonies. Its classical revival style of the beaux-arts was inspired by the Chicago World Fair of 1893 where the Baha'i Faith was first mentioned in America.This monument still stands today, dedicated to all men and women who helped achieve independence for the United States.",

On April 28th the Master came with Mrs. Parsons in the morning prior to leaving Washington. Again on November 6th the Master came with Mrs. Parsons and Mrs. Brown came as well. The President's Park is divided into the inner and outer portions, the inner portion including the 18 acres within the iron fence enclosing the Executive Mansion and grounds proper. The outer portion, also known as \"Grounds South of the Executive Mansion\" and the \"White Lot\", contains 52 acres and includes the Ellipse. It is bordered by Treasury Place, South Executive Avenue, State Place, 15th Street, 17th Street and Constitution Avenue. It was known as \"the White Lot\" due to the whitewashed wooden fence that enclosed the park in 1912. This is one of the two parks included in the original L'Enfant Plan for the Federal City and is closely associated with the history of the National Capital and with the lives of the Presidents. The Ellipse, the White House, the Jefferson Memorial and the White House are all on the special axis determined by Charles L­Enfant and Thomas Jefferson intended to be a new American Prime Meridian. Within the White Lot, is the Ellipse which was laid out during 1877-1880. At the middle of the Ellipse is a Meridian Stone, located 0.607 meters (1.99 feet) from the center of the Ellipse along its north-south axis. This area, used to lead down to Tyber Creek, and still slopes down so its southern point is fourteen feet lower then its northern point. The Ellipse, bordered by stately American elms, provides playing fields for various sports and is one of the most intensively utilized recreation grounds of the park system, until it has been closed during recent years. The \"Grounds South\" provide a park setting for the south facades of the Treasury and State-War-Navy Buildings, the Commerce Building on the east; and the Corcoran Art Gallery, the American Red Cross Building, the National Headquarters of the National Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the Hall of the Americas, home of the Pan-American Union, on the west.

              "Welcome to the home of Mr. Stanwood Cobb, at 19 Grafton Street in Chevy Chase Maryland, where the Master visited Mr. Cobb and walked along Conneticut Avenue. On May 9, the Master left Mrs. Parsons house at 6pm to visit Mr. Stanwood Cobb traveling with Ali Kuli Khan. In 1941 Hanna Lohse recorded what Ali Kuli Khan recalled of the visit, \"One day in 1912 when 'Abdu'l-Baha visited Washington he also came out to Chevy Chase. It had not extended as far as it is today. Mr. Cobb and Mr. McDaniel's homes are to the left of the circle. The center of the community. But the Master was walking with Dr. Khan then along a tree bordered by large beautiful trees which led to the north.. all of a sudden He stopped pointing ahead and said \"Here I see a brilliant light shining.\" Mr. Cobb in 1911 had registered himself as a member of the National Scoiety of the Sons of the American Revolution being the great-grandson of Ebenezer Cobb Jr. a private in Col. Ebenezer Sprout's Mass. Regiment. He was also a descendent of the Cobb on the second Mayflower voyage. Mr. Stanwood Cobb had a long and outstanding career as an educator. He was the founder and organizer of the Progressive Education Association and a renowned leader in the field of child psychology. Mr. Cobb founded and became principal of the Chevy Chase Country Day school in 1919, in the house visited by the Master. He was also president and founder of the Washington Authors Club. He was born in Newton, Massachusetts to Darius Cobb a Civil War soldier and a descendent of Elder Henry Cobb of the second voyage of the Mayflower. He had pursued his interest in religion to Green Acre Baha'i School in Eliot, Maine while studying comparative religion at Harvard Divinity School, and would later open Mast Cove Camp next to Green Acre. Between 1909 and 1913 he met 'Abdu'l-Baha five times. Cobb was a founding member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Washington DC. He lies burried in Rock Creek Park Cemetery in a Baha'i section including the gravesite of Ali Kuli Khan, having past away at 101 years of age on December 28th 1982. The circle Ali Kuli Khan mentioned is just east of Mr. Cobb's home, it is one of 33 circles in the District of Columbia. Chevy Chase Circle, unlike other circles in northwest Washington, D.C. was a later development of the Chevy Chase Land Company (Circa 1893), created to amplify the original city plan and add grandeur to the new residential area. The Chevy Chase Circle is located at the confluence of Western Avenue, Grafton Street, Magnolia Parkway, Chevy Chase Parkway, and Connecticut Avenue, straddling the border of Chevy Chase, Washington, D.C. and Chevy Chase, Maryland. Thus the tree lined street the Master walked along in a north bound trajectory would most likely have been Conneticut avenue which retains a beatuiful tree line to this day. Across the street from the Cobb house is the All Saints' Protestant Episcopal Church which was constructed in 1901, would have been a prominent site in 1912.",

On May 10th, Mrs. Parsons sent her carriage to the apartment on Harvard Street and 'Abdu'l-Baha and others drove to the office of the Orient-Occident Unity. The Master gave a talk on \"the importance of consultation in all work done by Baha'is\". The society had accomplished the first task it had addressed by establishing and funding an excellent American inspired school in Tehran, called the Tarbiyat School, which was even staffed by the neice of founder of the DC Baha'i community, Charlotte Britingham Dixon. They had also accomplished their second task of bringing to America of the first female Persian student, Ghodsea Khanum, who lived with the Barnitz family at 2626 University Place NW when in DC. During this visit, when the Master was staying in Mr. Ripley's apartment, Mr. Ripley also was living at 2626 University Place with the Barnitz family. Dr. Edward C. Getsinger, the lone American, in the Master's party also stayed with the Barnitz family! At the event in April the Master had advised the name change to Orient-Occident Unity and greatly expanded their role beyond educaiton, as the talk at the McLachlan Building repeated. Even before the name change the society's advertisement to the US Labor Bureau indicated this as follows: The Persian-American Educaitonal Society has called its Second Annual Convention to be held in the Carnegie Library, Washington D.C., April 18, 19, and 20, 1912. The announced object of the organization is to \"bring Persia and America closer together in ties of mutual interests - commercial, educaitonal, moral, and intellectual,\" and \"delegates from manufacturing and commerical bodies, boards of trade, and other societies will be welcomed and duly recognized.\" Further particulars may be secured by addressing the society at 509 McLachlan Building, Washington , D.C. The McLachlen Building itself was designed by noted architect Jules Henri de Sibour in 1910. The commercial building features a combination of Beaux-Arts and Classical Revival architecture.

Laura Dreyfus-Barney took the Master on a ride to what was then known as the Neighborhood House. We do not know the words spoken, but perhaps it was similar to the words and actions undertaken at the Bowery Mission in New York, where he said, \"So, my comrades, you are following in the footsteps of Jesus Christ. Your lives are similar to His life; your attitude is like unto His; you resemble Him more than the rich do. Therefore, we will thank God that we have been so blessed with real riches. And in conclusion, I ask you to accept 'Abdu'l-Baha as your servant,\" and then provided each individual a piece of silver. The Southwest Waterfront is part of Pierre L'Enfant's original city plans and includes some of the oldest buildings in the city, including the Wheat Row block of townhouses, built in 1793, and Fort McNair, which was established in 1791 as \"the U.S. Arsenal at Greenleaf Point.\" After the Civil War, the Southwest Waterfront became a neighborhood for the poorer classes of Washingtonians. The neighborhood was divided in half by Fourth Street SW, then known as 4 1\/2 Street; Amiercans of Scottish, Irish, German, and eastern European descent lived west of 4 1\/2 Street, while liberated Americans of African descent lived to the east. Each half was centered around religious establishments: St. Dominic's Catholic Church and Temple Beth Israel on the west, and Friendship Baptist Church on the east. Also, each half of the neighborhood was the childhood residence of a future American musical star Al Jolson lived on 4 1\/2 Street for a time, and Marvin Gaye was born in a tenement on First Street. The west side was served by this Neighborhood House and a plaque on 470 N Street commemorates this service. The Neighborhood House was founded in 1901 in Southwest Washington by Charles F. Weller, Eugenia Winston Weller and John B. Sleman, Jr. Social services were provided out of a house at 470 N Street, S.W. Leadership was provided by a resident staff of four workers and a large corps of volunteers. Alice Pike Barney was an active volunteer and benefactor of the House. Her daughters, Natalie and Laura, continued the Barney family interest for many years. In 1933, the name Neighborhood House was changed to Barney Neighborhood House and Social and Industrial Settlement. In 1960, Barney selected the Mt. Pleasant area in Northwest Washington as its new home. Social and community development services were rendered from loaned facilities until a suitable property was obtained in March 1963 at 3118 16th Street, N.W. In 1973, the growth and expansion of services soon necessitated the acquisition of an additional facility at 1737 Columbia Road, N.W. to house a Senior Citizen's Center. In the continued sustained growth of the organization, in 2001, Barney moved its Administrative and social services to 5656A 3rd Street, NE and located its supportive services to 504 Kennedy Street, NW. In April 1981, Barney was designated the lead agency for services to the elderly in Wards I and IV. A new branch office was opened at 8th and Jefferson Streets, N.W. and nutrition and supportive services to 1,000 senior citizens at 14 satellite centers were inaugurated. Today they are the lead agency for Ward IV where we operate 6 nutrition sites, the Ward IV Wellness Center and the citywideWashington Elderly Handicapped transportation Service. Today, the Barney Neighborhood House remains a stable institution in a changing community, providing a means of uniting the community in the delivery of social services to its residents in need, and happily accepts volunteers and is accepting board member applications. The Mission of Barney Neighborhood House is to enhance the lives of the citizens of the District of Columbia by providing social services, health care, and education with special emphasis on the elderly, youth, and the mentally challenged. They believe that our first responsibility is to provide programs and services for senior citizens and the mentally challenged in our community and all others who can benefit from our services.",

              "Welcome to the Barney Home, at 1626 Rhode Island Avenue, an emergent headquarters of the Woman's Suffrage movement addressed by the Master. On May 10th, the Master came with Mme. Laura Dreyfus-Barney to the home her family constructed thirty years prior to address a meeting of women. He \"spoke on rights and education of women.\" It helped spark a flurry of peace and suffrage activity in the home. Alice was in the process of joining the suffragettes and provided the Rhode Island residence rent free to the National Women's Suffrage Association for its headquarters. She wrote two plays for the group, both widely acclaimed and successful. By 1916 the headquarters of the National American Woman Suffrage Association moved its headquarters to the house. This was occupied by the committee, national officers, the lobbyists and other workers until July, 1919, when the amendment had been submitted by Congress. In the suffrage army more than two millions of women were enlisted. The parent body, the National American Woman Suffrage Association, directed the activities of the great mass of them, while the Woman's Party projected its entirely separate and often conflicting program for the group pursuing non-violent activism. When victory finally perched upon the banners of the suffragists the National Suffrage Association had direct auxiliaries in 46 States of the Union and these far-reaching confederated bodies were functioning as one organ through its centralized national board. Her thoughts and work continued to her passing, when returning to Washington in 1922, she wrote a one-act play as a benefit for the National Women's party; it ran for 14 sold-out performances at the Belasco. Aside from Suffrage Alice had also long worked for peace. When the US government declared war on Spain on April 25, 1898. Alice planned and directed a theatrical benefit to raise money for the sick and wounded veterans. In the final scene there was a tableau by Alice called War, Victory and Peace, posed by society women. War was draped all in red with her long, dark hair flowing over her shoulders. Victory, dressed in white, carried a gold trumpet raised to her lips, and laurel leaves. Peace, gowned in purple and gold, carried a white dove. While they posed, the U.S. Marine Band played The Star Spangled Banner. The first performance on May 9 before 500 of the Washington elite, including President William McKinley, was so successful that a repeat performance was held the following week. The two nights raised about $1,000 for each wounded soldier. A newspaper reported, ``Mrs. Alice Barney's greatest artistic triumph was the tableau. Each one of these were oil paintings in themselves, with every detail of the background, coloring and picture effect carefully thought out.’' In 1914, she was elected president of the Washington branch of the newly founded Women's Peace Party, established by the future 1931 Nobel Peace Prize winner Jane Addams. When the Germans sank the Lusitania May 7, 1915, the Women's Peace Party, which Alice had joined, decided to present a tableau to influence public opinion from military involvement in the war. For it Alice wrote The Awakening, which was presented at the foot of Washington Monument on May 30. A crowd of 6,000 attended the free performance. Alice did her best to promote the cause of peace and prevent the entry of the United States into World War I by writing and presenting plays and pageants. She presented one play by Laura called The Opium Pipe to five sell-out performances to benefit the French Ambulance Fund. Her daughter Laura Dreyfuss-Barney continued the work like unto her mother Alice. Laura became an active campaigner for women's rights and world peace. She was a member of different committees with the League of Nations and latter UNESCO. During World War One, Laura Dreyfus-Barney served in the American Ambulance Corps (1914-15), and the American Red Cross (1916-18) in France, and helped to establish the first childrens hospital in Avignon (1918). The remainder of her life was devoted to international humanitarian and philanthropic activities, most connected with the League of Nations and the United Nations. For her services she was named chevalier (1925) and officer (1937) of the French L©gion dHonneur for her service to france during both world wars. She formed, under the aegis of the League of Nations, the \"Liaison Committee of Major International Organizations\" to promote better understanding between peoples and classes, and became a permanent member of the committee as well as its liaison officer. She was the only woman appointed by the League Council to sit on the Sub- Committee of Experts on Education, a post which she held for many years, beginning in 1926. She was vice president of the Disarmament Committee created by the International Women's Organizations in 1933, which represented fifteen organizations with branches in fifty-six countries. The International Bahai­ Bureau was maintained even after the League of Nations ceased to function. As American citizens, Laura was forced to leave Paris at the outbreak of the Second World War. Laura\nreturned to Washington. It was during that time that she represented the National Council of Women of the United States on its Coordinating Committee for Better Racial Understanding, and served on several other boards. During World War II, Laura Dreyfus-Barney was a delegate of the French National Committee on Women to the Commission on Racial Affairs. She organized, under the auspices of the International Institute of Educational Cinematography of the League of Nations, the first congress for women, held in Rome. She also became a member of the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations on Teaching; she was also a member of the French Committee on Intellectual Cooperation. Later, she became a member of its Board and an officer of the American Society of the French Legion of Honor. The building itself was built from Albert Barney's fortune ($90 million today) - he constructed the town residence at 1626 Rhode Island Avenue, N.W. in the fashionable area off Scott Circle. With its music room, library, inner courtyard, and picture gallery, there was nothing modest about the huge Italian-style manor with its odd Gothic touches.",

              "Welcome to the residence of the Master, at 1901 18th Street, during His November visit. The house which Dr. Getsinger had found, was the first place that the Master came on his November visit from Union Station on November 6th. The House was furnished and large enough for entire party. Dr. Getsinger found it. And the wpopel who were there went away. The Master would see many visitors at the house, but would give most of his public talks at other venues, principally the Parsons. One talk He did give here was his morning of the 10th of November, near final address to the DC Baha'i community. He told them that He was happy with them, \"I am greatly pleased with the friends in Washington and experience real happiness in meeting them.\" He then reinforced the integrative steps He had lifted the community to far above Social Liberalism and Tolerance, with the words, \"May you serve the Cause of God as one single, united force. I give you the glad tidings that the confirmations of God will descend upon you. Be ye assured of this. Ye will become illumined. Ye will become conquerors.\" Thereafter, the friends and seekers continued to see Him until noon and after lunch as well. That evening He would give talks at the Parsons and then the Hannens, and return to prepare to depart Washington for the last time in the morning of the 10th. Two photos were taken here at 1901 18th Street with the house and the Master in them. Lorraine Hopper is standing in the doorway with the Master. Her parents were part of the second wave of development of the DC Baha'i Community. Charlotte Brittingham Dixon had founded the community of seven believers when, in answer to a prophecy as Charlotte saw it, the group of Paris Baha'is arrived Laura Barney, Charles Mason Remey, Alice Pike Barney and Mr. Hopper who had all studied with Miss May Bolles who had jsut returend from pilgrimage and set the group of young students and artists alight with a light from heaven. Mr. Hopper had remained skeptical following Miss May Bolles lessons, so he had set out from Paris to Acca to meet the Master. Mr. Hopper's spiritual experience in meeting 'abdu'l-Baha reveals the splendour of the Baha'i relevlation to those first western disciples. His wife tells the story of how Mr. Hopper came to Acca \"a critical, skeptical man who was proud never to be swept by an empitonal experince. He was suddenly ushered into Abdul Baha's prison room. Before he knew what had happened, he saw a blaze of white light and like Paul in the road to Damascus, fell down in wonder, overwhelmed by the spiritual glory which shone through and around his Beloved. The next moment Abdu'l Baha infinitely tender love was lifting him in His arms. The Master had opened to him the doors of the unseen kingdom of glory; then gently He closed them again.” The taking of the other photo was detailed by an eye witness, whose mother took down these notes in her memoirs: The photo was requested by Florence Khanum Khan, and the Master had given Florence permission, much coveted, to have her three children photographed in His presence, and had assigned a definite hour and date. The Khans' Washington house was closed at the time, the family were staying in Vienna, Virginia and came into the city a day before the great event. Khan himself was off on an official mission, to speak at an International Agricultural Conference in Alberta, Canada. Florence and their nurse brought the children, they in crisp white clothes and temporarily spit and span, to the large Washington house rented by 'Abdu'l-Baha. A crowd had already gathered at the house to hear the Master's morning address, and there were several photographers milling around in the lower entrance hall with their cameras and tripods. Florence and the children, having an appointment, were at once ushered upstairs to 'Abdu'l-Baha'­ reception room. The room was full of light, with transparent white curtains. There was as usual a party atmosphere when He was present, a quickening. Comings and goings, flowers, candies, electric air, the people somehow enhanced. As Juliet Thompson wrote of Him in her Diary, 'The Master has a strange quality of beautifying His environment.’ As ever, He welcomed Florence with the great dignity of a high-born Persian gentleman. Time and again, she writes in her notes that His manners were faultless, His courtesy unexampled although His thus noticing her, as it had in Akk¡ at His table embarrassed her much. Florence asked Him if she too could be in the photograph. 'Abdu'l-Baha answered, 'Khan is not here. Later, when he returns, it may be done.' And it was done, later on in November just prior to His departure, and the result was a remarkable portrait of the Master, with Florence and Khan behind His chair. Florence complained afterward that it had rained that day and dampened down the feathers on her hat.\nNow Florence worried, thinking that if the photographers did not come upstairs at once, the three active children would play about and crush their well-ironed clothes. Everyone's garments were complicated then, for it was long decades before the era of do-it-yourself, and a maid could spend half an hour ironing an infant's lacy, layered dress. The youngest began running back and forth, to the Master, then away from Him.\n'Come here!' He said to the tiny girl. 'Give me a kiss!'\nHamideh leaned toward Him and then coquettishly withdrew her face.\nFlorence called out, 'Kiss the Master!' The child tossed her head.\n'Very well,' He said, 'if you will not kiss me, I will kiss you.'\nAt which the little girl turned up the right side of her face to Him. He bent and, as if inhaling scent from a flower, kissed the soft cheek and as she darted away, He said, 'Ah!' as though He had tasted nectar.\nThe photographers came in and requested 'Abdu'l-Baha to sit in a large chair while they grouped the children about Him. Thy took a long time fiddling with the equipment and adjusting positions. While the photographers were doing this, a woman appeared at the door.\n'Please tell the Master the audience is getting restless,' she said. 'Time is passing!'\nHe turned to Florence and said, 'Shall we take the picture later, Kh¡num?'\nJust as you wish, Master,' she answered. 'But I brought them specially for this, from Virginia, and now their clothing is fresh.'\nHe sent word, 'I will come downstairs shortly.' Then He asked the photographer to please hurry, as the time was up.\nThe children were told to hold very still because there was going to be a flash and a loud noise. The older girl braced herself, the right hand a tense fist, the left supporting her rigidly against the side of the Master's chair. She looked out the window while the photographer was again adjusting his camera, and saw a chestnut tree with burrs on it. 'Whenever I see a tree with those burrs on,' she told herself, 'I must remember this.' (Who could have put that unlikely thought in her mind? In any case, from that day on, such a tree with burrs on it has, like a message, invariably made her think of that morning.)\nHe is shown seated for the photographer, one child at either side of Him, the third held before Him in a standing position and encircled by His arms. He is pressing candy into her hand, not making a special thing of it, not demonstratively but routinely, feeding her the way a bird feeds its young in the nest, because it has to: He could not help helping, He was all-bountiful. A prayer of His tells us, when we call upon God, to be 'expectant and full of hope' clearly a fledgling's stridently confident and open-beaked attitude, and clearly the Divine cannot be separated from ceaseless grace.\nHe could not help serving. Khan often quoted a sacred tradition, a had­ th of Isl¡m, which says that a day would come when God would appear in His Divinity, and all on earth would be struck with terror, and would flee away. Then He would disappear, and would reappear in the garment of servitude for 'Servitude is an essence the substance of which is Divinity'. This, Khan would say, was fulfilled by 'Abdu'l-Baha, whose very name Abd means servant.\nAs He passed her with His interpreter on the way to the door, He paused, and poured forth 'such an unexpected volume of praise, of bounty, of confirmations and promises for the future', that Florence was 'speechless with a kind of paralyzed wonder and amazement at such overwhelming statements of loving kindness'. She hung her head 'and could only with my deafened ears hear His blessed voice going on and on, anointing me with the divine blessings of God’.\n\n\nTALKS 'Abdu'l-Baha DELIVERED IN WASHINGTON\n\n10 November 1912 Talk at 1901 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D. C.\nNotes by Joseph H. Hannen\n\nI am greatly pleased with the friends in Washington and experience real happiness in meeting them. Likewise, I am pleased with the friends from Baltimore, for I have observed that their hearts are attracted to the love of Baha'u'llah. Their vision is extended toward the Kingdom of Bah¡. Their spirits are rejoicing in the glad tidings of Abh¡. Verily, they are servants of the Cause of God. All are engaged in service, and the perfection of their desire is to enter into the Kingdom of Abh¡ and draw near unto God. For that reason I am very happy and well pleased with them. I pray for you all. May the favors of the Blessed Beauty, Baha'u'llah, encompass you, and may the lights of the Sun of Reality be your illumination. May you all become united and assured. May you serve the Cause of God as one single, united force. I give you the glad tidings that the confirmations of God will descend upon you. Be ye assured of this. Ye will become illumined. Ye will become conquerors.\n\nBut after I leave, some people may arise in opposition, heaping persecutions upon you in their bitterness, and in the newspapers there may be articles published against the Cause. Rest ye in the assurance of firmness. Be well poised and serene, remembering that this is only as the harmless twittering of sparrows and that it will soon pass away. If such things do not happen, the fame of the Cause will not become widespread, and the summons of God will not be heard. Consider the history of the past. Recall, for instance, the days of Christ and the events subsequent thereto. How many were the books written against Him! What calumnies were attributed to Him! How violent were the utterances in the temples against Him! How many the accusations! What hatred and persecution! How they scoffed at Him in derision and contempt! Consider the titles and epithets they bestowed upon His majesty! They even designated Him Beelzebub Satan. They said Beelzebub had been captured and crucified. They placed a crown of thorns upon Beelzebubs head and paraded Him through the streets. This was the name the Jews bestowed upon Christ; it is written in the Gospel. There were many other forms of reviling and persecution, spitting in His beautiful face, cursing and anathematizing, bowing backward toward Him, saying, Peace be on thee, thou king of the Jews! Peace be on thee, thou destroyer of the temple! Peace be on thee, thou king and pretender who would restore the temple in three days! The philosophers of the times, Romans and Greeks, wrote against Christ. Even the kings wrote books of abuse, calumny and contempt. One of these kings was a Caesar. He was also a philosopher. In his book he says, concerning the people of Christ, The most degraded of people are the Christians. The most immoral of the people of this time are the Christians. Jesus of Nazareth has led them astray. O people! If you wish to know who Jesus is and what Christian means, go and ask his relatives. Go and ask the Jews who know him. See what a bad person he is, how degraded he is. There were many similar accounts. But remember that these statements did not affect the cause of Christianity. On the contrary, Christianity advanced daily in power and potency.\n\nDay by day the majesty of Christ grew in splendor and effulgence. Therefore, my purpose is to warn and strengthen you against accusations, criticisms, revilings and derision in newspaper articles or other publications. Be not disturbed by them. They are the very confirmation of the Cause, the very source of upbuilding to the Movement. May God confirm the day when a score of ministers of the churches may arise and with bared heads cry at the top of their voices that the Bahai's are misguided. I would like to see that day, for that is the time when the Cause of God will spread. Baha'u'llah has pronounced such as these the couriers of the Cause. They will proclaim from pulpits that the Bahai's are fools, that they are a wicked and unrighteous people, but be ye steadfast 430 and unwavering in the Cause of God. They will spread the message of Baha'u'llah.\n\nHis Honor Mirza Abul-Faá¸l has written a treatise answering the criticisms of a London preacher. Each one of you should have a copy. Read, memorize and reflect upon it. Then, when accusations and criticisms are advanced by those unfavorable to the Cause, you will be well armed.",

This was once the headquarters of the National Woman's Party (the world's first women's political party, founded in 1916) Co-founder Evelyn Wotherspoon Wainwright met with 'Abdu'l-Bahá twice. On November 8th, Mrs. Wainwright joined a luncheon at the Parsons home. Around the table was the Master, and on His right Mrs. Greely, Dr. Fareed, Mrs. Wainwright, Gen. Greely, Sallie Stockton, Dr. Getsinger, and Mrs. Agnes Parsons. While the details of the conversation are not yet known, records reveal that at another evening dinner at Mrs Parsons, 'Abdu'l-Bahá asked with a smile, “What would you say if a woman were to become President of the United States?” In 1912, the remark 'came like a bombshell', Mrs. Florence Khan wrote. Mrs. Khan comments that from any other than the Master this 'far cry into the future [this totally new idea] would have been incredible'. Mrs. Wainwright returned the following night, going with Mrs. Parsons first, to the 8:30 pm talk on November 9th, and thereafter to the farewell banquet for the Master. After the banquet the Master invited Mrs. Wainwright and Mrs. Parsons to a smaller room in which were gathered some of the Master's entourage. \"We were addressed twice by 'Abdu'l-Bahá during the feast,\" Mrs. Parsons wrote in her diary, \"and exquisite prayers were offered by Him for our advancement and firmness.\"",

This dining hall was built on the same place as Raucher's Hall, 1034 Connecticut Avenue, where the Master's farewell banquet was held at 10pm on November 9th. It was one of the few European-Descent American owned locations in legally segregated Washington DC, where integrated seating was acceptable to the owners. The Master arrived at 10pm to be received by 200 believers and friends. The large tables were arranged in the shape of the number 9, nine being a symbolic representation of the Baha'i Faith in so far as it represents the largest possible number which is still united within a single digit. The Master opened the evening with a prayer, \"He is God! O Lord! We are assembled here in the utmost love and are turned toward Thy Kingdom. We seek none other but Thee and desire not but Thy good pleasure. O Lord! Make this food heavenly and make those assembled here of the hosts of Thy Supreme Concourse so that they may become life-giving and the cause of the enlightenment of the world of man, that they may arise to guide all the peoples of the world. Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Forgiving and the Kind.\" He went from place to place giving boxes of sweets and flowers out of his own hands. He anointed each head with a perfume like lemon verbena and attar of rose. Afterward, in the adjoining room He provided a number of private interviews.\n\nMrs. Alice Pike Hemmick often hosted fundraisers here for her neighborhood house as well as for a formal reception associated with the First Annual Conference of the Persian-American Educational Society which had occurred a year earlier. On 16 April 1911, accompanied by two friends of the family, the society arranged for Ghodsieh Ashraf Khanum to leave Tehran and travel to England via Anzali, Baku, Batumi, and Vienna. The voyage from Southampton to New York on The Mauretania was made in the custody of Louis G. Gregory, a prominent African-Descent Washington Baha'i. She landed in New York on 3 June 1911. Within less than a fortnight, on 16 and 17 June, she participated in the first annual conference of the Persian-American Educational Society, an association for cultural exchange, in Washington, D.C. Her speech in English about the progress of Persian women stirred great emotion, as did her address at a reception at Rauschers Hall, which she attended as the guest of honor.\n\nThe following extract from the address on Persian Women, by Mirza Ahmad Sohrab, delivered before the 1911 Conference of the Persian-American Education Society, fittingly introduces Ghodsia Ashraf Khanum:\n\nThe charming young Persian girl who expects to make America her home for the next four years: For ages past the life of the Persian woman has been a monotonous dream, and on account of the stringent restrictions which have been imposed upon her by the so-called lord and master of creation, she has been kept in the background. The laws which were falsely instituted by the religious body of the country demanded her entire seclusion and her nonassociation with man. If she ever took any such privileges, her life would have been forfeited. She could not take part in those activities which would naturally develop her innate noble nature. She was considered as an inferior being, created from a rib of man, a weak creature who had to be looked after and in order to win the gracious smile of her husband she had to become less than a shadow and more of a fairy. Talk of freedom, she did not know even its meaning; she was a mere chattel in the household, and as such she had no right or power. However, the time when she was satisfied and put up with these dreary conditions is past. Since the declaration of the constitutional regime there has been great progress among the women of Persia. Notwithstanding the strenuous opposition of the priesthood, scores of modern schools have been established in different parts of the country where girls are educated and the new ideals of life in their careers. This new order of things is amply demonstrated by the presence of Ghodsia Khanum in this gathering. She has traveled thousands of miles and has risked everything in the search for knowledge. This is the first instance in the history of the modern development of Persian women that they have consented to send one of their numbers so far away. It is a great compliment to America, a testimony to the courage and fearlessness of Persian women and a demonstration of the usefulness of this Society. If this Society has not accomplished during its short and yet useful career but this one service, it has amply shown it is a living and dynamic organ, which will work in the future for the higher progress and advancement of Persian women. A few years ago it would have been impossible for any Persian woman to leave her country, for such a clamor would have been raised from the clergy as to create social chaos and disorder. But now we hope the chains are broken, the doors are opened and from now on many others will come every year to enter the Colleges and Seminaries in America, imbued with the principles of social freedom and equality and carry back the same to their own sisters. Ghodsia, eldest daughter of Mirza Fazl Khan, was born in Tehran, Persia, Nov. 22, 1889. From her childhood she manifested a great desire for learning. Her preliminary training was received in the Persian Girls School, after which she spent two years in the American School of Tehran. Her father having been born a Bahai, had always encouraged her in seeking knowledge. 'Abdu'l-Bahá granted her permission to come to America to prepare herself for teaching, and when her studies here are completed she expects to return to Persia to assist in the educational work there. Ghodsia is the first Persian girl who removed the veil, left her home and crossed land and sea for the sake of uplifting her people. She left Tehran on April 16th, arriving in America on June 3, 1911, and is now enrolled as a student at the Lewis Institute in Chicago.\n\n\nTalks 'Abdu'l-Bahá delivered in Washington, D.C.\n9 November 1912\nTalk at Bahai Banquet\nRauscher's Hall, Washington, D. C.\nNotes by Joseph H. Hannen\n\nBefore eating 'Abdu'l-Bahá rose and recited the following prayer:\n\nHe is God! O Lord! We are assembled here in the utmost love and are turned toward Thy Kingdom. We seek none other but Thee and desire not but Thy good pleasure. O Lord! Make this food heavenly and make those assembled here of the hosts of Thy Supreme Concourse so that they may become life-giving and the cause of the enlightenment of the world of man, that they may arise to guide all the peoples of the world. Thou art the All-Powerful, the Almighty, the Forgiving and the Kind.\n\nI feel a keen sense of joy in being present at this banquet this evening, for --praise be to God!-- before me are radiant faces, ears attuned to the melodies of the Supreme Concourse, hearts aglow with the fire of the love of God, spirits exhilarated through the glad tidings of God, souls sheltered beneath the overshadowing power of the Kingdom of Abha. I see before me an assemblage of souls who are of the chosen and not of the many called. And it is my hope that through the favors of Bahá’u’lláh He may continue to attract you to His Kingdom and render you victorious and triumphant in your service to the oneness and solidarity of mankind. May He assist all who are firm in establishing the unity of the inhabitants of this earth. May all of you thereby become my partners and coadjutors in servitude.\n\nO Lord! Confirm and aid this assemblage. Confirm these souls through the breaths of Thy Holy Spirit. Enlighten the eyes by the vision of these radiant lights, and make the ears joyful through the anthems of Thy call to service. O God! Verily, we have gathered here in the fragrance of Thy love. We have turned to Thy Kingdom. We seek naught save Thee and desire nothing save Thy good pleasure. O God! Let this food be Thy manna from heaven, and grant that this assemblage may be a concourse of Thy supreme ones. May they be the quickening cause of love to humanity and the source of illumination to the human race. May they be the instruments of Thy guidance upon earth. Verily, Thou art powerful. Thou art the Bestower. Thou art the Forgiver, and Thou art the Almighty.\n\nIn the world many banquets, assemblages and meetings have been organized, but those gatherings have been commercial, political, educational or social in their purpose and motive. Meetings are held for the promotion of financial plans or promulgation of the arts and sciences. Others have sought to establish agricultural industries or consummate territorial agreements. Innumerable assemblages have been held for consultation upon subjects of learning and education. All such meetings have for their object the advancement of civilization. But, --Praise be to God!-- this banquet and this assemblage are for none other purpose than love, for the purpose of announcing the divine Kingdom, for the manifestation of the ineffable traces of God, for reflecting the effulgences of the Kingdom of God, for binding hearts together, for service to the world of humanity, for the promulgation of humanitarian and altruistic realities, for the advancement and advocating of international peace, for the illumination of the whole world. Therefore, such an assemblage is matchless and peerless because other assemblages are held for a limited object and personal motive, whereas this meeting is for God and God only, for His love and purpose. It is for love of the hearts of men and the oneness of the world of humanity. Therefore, we should offer thanks to God, for He has confirmed us in attaining to the happiness of this occasion. He has appointed us servants of the human world, advocates of peace and unity among the religions, heralds of universal agreement among the races and nations, founders of divine reconciliation among all peoples.\n\nIt is my fond and fervent hope through the favor of God that this present meeting may be instrumental in ushering in the day when the standard of the oneness of the world of humanity shall be held aloft in America. May it be the first real foundation of international peace, having for its object universal service to man. May it be divine philanthropy without distinctions or differentiations in humankind. May you consider all religions the instruments of God and regard all races as channels of divine manifestation. May you view mankind as the sheep of God and know for a certainty that He is the real Shepherd. Consider how this kind and tender Shepherd cares for all His flock; how He leads them in green pastures and beside the still waters. How well He protects them! Verily, this Shepherd makes no distinctions whatsoever; to all the sheep He is equally kind. Therefore, we must follow the example of God and strive in pathways of goodwill toward all humanity. May we endeavor with heart and soul to reconcile the religions of the earth, unify the peoples and races and blend the nations in a perfect solidarity. May we uphold the flag of international agreement and enkindle a light which shall illumine all regions with the radiance of oneness. May our purposes centralize in the earnest desire of attaining the good pleasure of God, and may our supreme energies be directed to welding together the human household. Let us not regard our own respective capacities; nay, rather, let us regard forever the favors and bounties of God. The drop must not estimate its own limited capacity; it must realize the volume and sufficiency of the ocean, which ever glorifieth the drop. The tender and simple seed, solitary though it may be, must not look upon its own lack of power. Nay, rather, its attention must ever be directed to the sun, in the rays of which it finds life and quickening; and it must ever consider the downpour of the cloud of mercy. For the bounty of the cloud, the effulgence and heat of the sun and the breath of the vernal zephyrs can transform the tiny seed and develop it into a mighty tree. And may you remember that a single infinitesimal atom in the ray of the sun through a shining beam of the solar energy becomes glorified and radiant.\n\nTherefore, let us ever trust in God and seek confirmation and assistance from Him. Let us have perfect and absolute confidence in the bounty of the Kingdom. Review the events surrounding souls of bygone times in the beginning of their day; and again consider them when, through the aid and assistance of God, they proved to be the mighty ones of God. Remember that Peter was a fisherman, but through the bounty of the Kingdom he became the great apostle. Mary Magdalene was a villager of lowly type, yet that selfsame Mary was transformed and became the means through which the confirmation of God descended upon the disciples. Verily, she served the Kingdom of God with such efficiency that she became well-known and oft mentioned by the tongues of men. Even today she is shining from the horizon of eternal majesty. Consider how infinite is the bounty of God that a woman such as Mary Magdalene should be selected by God to become the channel of confirmation to the disciples and a light of nearness in His Kingdom. Consequently, trust ye in the bounty and grace of God, and rest assured in the bestowals of His eternal outpouring. I hope that each one of you may become a shining light even as these electric lights are now brilliant in their intensity. Nay, may each one of you be a luminary like unto a sparkling star in the heaven of the divine Will. This is my supplication at the throne of God. This is my hope through the favors of Bahá’u’lláh. I offer this prayer in behalf of all of you and beg with a contrite heart that you may be assisted and glorified with an eternal bestowal.",

De Langel has also passed on and is buried alongside the spot visited by the Master with a beautiful testimony to her Faith inscribed upon her grand gravestone. The November visit was made in a carriage along with Mr. Charles Mason Remey, Mrs. Nliza A. Duffield and Mrs. Caludei Stuart Coles. Mr. De Lagnel was a US Army officer beginning in 1847, and joined the civil war on the side of the enslavers, and after the war ran a Pacific steamship service. No doubt Mrs. J. C. de Lagnel was one of the students of Mirza Abu'l-Fad'l, as upon his passing she held a memorial in her spacious parlor filled with the Baha'is of Washington DC.

              "Welcome to the Federal Aviation Administration Building, at 804 Independence Ave SW, where the Master visited the former Baha'i Hospice. Long before the street was renamed from B street to Independence Avenue in 1934, the Washington Baha'i community relied upon traveling teachers to bring news from the Holy Land as well as to participate in the various efforts to teach the Baha'i Faith in Washington. The date the Master visited the home in 1912, is not recorded. The home was run by Aseyeh Allen and renowned for her entertaining Believers of the East and of the West in its halls. During His visit the Master wrote a prayer for her second son Golshan, in her Baha'i guest book as follows:\n\n\"O Thou Almighty! Suffer this child to ascend to the sphere of Thy Faith and Wisdom; train him in the bosom of Thy Bestowals so that he may find Thee and become illumined.\"\n\nThe Master, as with many Bahá’ís at the time, had named Aseyeh Allen. In a Tablet dating to 1905, addressed to the Bahá’í Wallsca (Pollock) Dyar, the wife of Harrison G. Dyar, the Master states:\n\n\"That blessed name which thou hast asked to remain with thee forever and become the cause of spiritual progress -- that name is \"Aseyeh,\" which is the name of the mother of 'Abdu'l-Bahá. I give the blessed name to thee. Be therefore in the utmost joy and happiness, and be engaged in all gladness and attraction (or ecstasy) for thou hast become the object of such a favour.\"\n\nÁsíyih Khánum (1820 - 1886) was the wife of Bahá’u’lláh, the founder of the Bahá’í Faith. She is viewed by Bahá’ís as the paragon of a devoted mother and wife. She is also known by her titles of, Navváb, the Most Exalted Leaf, and Ásíyih Khánum. Bahá’u’lláh and Ásíyih Khánum were known as the Father of the Poor and the Mother of Consolation for their extraordinary generosity and regard for the impoverished.\n\nÁsíyih Khánum was born Ásíyih Yalrúdí,­ the only daughter of Mírzá Ismá’íl Yalrúdí, the Vizier, or minister. Ásíyih Khánum was born in Mazandaran, Persia to a wealthy noble family. Her father was a minister in the court of the King of Persia and highly influential and wealthy. In October 1835 the fifteen-year-old Ásíyih Khánum married Bahá’u’lláh in a grand and sumptuous ceremony with the buttons on Ásíyih Khánum clothes as jewels. The early years of the marriage were apparently happy, with Ásíyih and Bahá’u’lláh occupying themselves with philanthropy though naturally Ásíyih only helped the women and young children. The marriage resulted in seven children: including ''Abdu'l-Bahá. Ásíyih Khánum was very close to her children, and took active participation in their upbringing.\n\nIn 1844 Bahá’u’lláh heard of a new faith Bábísm and accepted. At 23, Ásíyih Khánum accepted the faith and her family became one of its most prominent members. On 15 August 1852, the entire  Bábí community suffered a general pogrom in Persia. Ásíyih was not spared. Her home was looted, its possessions were taken away and she was left in practical poverty. Ásíyih was delivered from being one of the most wealthy and influential families of Persia to penury in one night.\n\nIn 1852 her husband was arrested because of his  Bábí faith. Her home was looted again and the family were left in destitution. She lived in constant fear in case Bahá’u’lláh would be executed witnessing everyday one  Bábí being killed. She sold parts of her dowry and used them to bribe guards to give food to her husband. An edict arrived banishing the family to Baghdad. When her husband was exiled in the freezing January of 1853 she was pregnant.\nThe family were subsequently exiled again to Constantinople in 1863. Shortly after the arrival in Constantinople they were exiled, again to the remote Adrianople. A royal command was issued in July 1868 condemning the Bábí\/Bahá’ís to perpetual imprisonment and isolation in far-flung outposts of the Ottoman Empire Acre in Ottoman Palestine for Bahá’u’lláh and his family. The inhabitants of Acre were told that the new prisoners were enemies of the state, of God and his religion, and that association with them was strictly forbidden.\nIn 1870 restrictions were eased for the family and they were moved from the prison. As the people of Acre started to respect the Bahá’ís and in particular,‘Abdu’l-Bahá. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá was able to arrange for a house to be rented for the family, and the family finally moved to a country Mansion just outside of Acre around 1879 when an epidemic caused its inhabitants to flee.\n\nÁsíyih personally helped women and children of Acre who were struck with illness nursing them to health. s­yih spent most of her time devoted to piety and her family. Abdu'l-Bahá  wrote about his mother:\n\n\"And truly the humiliation and reproach which she suffered in the path of God is a fact which no one can refute. For the calamities and afflictions mentioned in the whole chapter are such afflictions which she suffered in the path of God, all of which she endured with patience and thanked God therefore and praised Him, because He had enabled her to endure afflictions for the sake of Bahá. During all this time, the men and women persecuted her in an incomparable manner, while she was patient, God-fearing, calm, humble and contented through the favor of her Lord and by the bounty of her Creator.\"\n\nThe tradition of a DC Bahá’í Hospice dates earlier than the Allen residence. In March 1910 a notice that the Bahá’í Hospice was located at 214 B Street SE where Mr. Ripley (in 1912 at the 1336 Harvard residence of Abdu'l-Bahá), dispensed hospitality to all the visiting friends was advertised in the national Bahá’í newsletter. In April of 1910, when Washington rejoiced at the return of their beloved sister Lua Getsinger, upon her return from the Holy City, the friends tendered a reception at the home of Mr. and Mrs. Ripley. During her stay at the hospice, as an example, she spoke at the Sunday School, received friends at the Hospice, attend group meetings, as well as regular meetings around the city. By December 1910, the Hospice had moved to the 804 B Street location with Mrs. Marie A. Watson and Miss M. Althea Dorr spending the winter season in Washington. Today, the building no longer stands but a view of the expanse of \"B\" street can be enjoyed from the Smithsonian's Hirshhorn Museum across the street.\n",

              "Welcome to the Fort Lincoln Cemetery, where Charlotte Brittingham Dixon, Founder of the DC Bahá’í Community and First Bahá’í in All the Southern States of America, is buried together with other prominent Baha'is. Her grave can be found when looking for the \"BRITTINGHAM\" family headstone in section E at the North Eastern midpoint of Chapel Drive, just beside the road. The plots in the cemetery state the family name and then indicate the location of family members below the family name. Her grave is notable for the number 9 upon it, signalling the Bahá’í Faith. Beside her you will find her sister Henrietta Brittingham, who helped pioneer the Faith to many cities in the US, including Princess Anne, Maryland where from came all the first Standard Bearers of the Cause of God in the Southern States through this one blessed family. The Brittingham Family provided refuge to the Millerites in Princess Anne during the Great Awakening related to the expectation of Christ's imminent return that accompanied the birth of the Bahá’í Faith in 1844. Charlotte's daughter, Louise Dixon Boyle is buried directly up the hill from the Brittingham grave, together with her husband Roger Boyle. Louise received 54 tablets from the Master in her lifetime. Roger Boyle, on whose family's farm most of the Cemetery is located, was distinguished in his own right, having been the lead engineer on the construction of the Bahá’í House of Worship in Chicago, Illinois from its conception through the 1940s. Their grave is without a family stone (it is likely missing given that Roger served as one of Fort Lincoln's founding executive directors, and the cemetery land was his family’s, which is worthy of further study). It is found in section I to the East side of the \"Little Church of Fort Lincoln\", just to the side of the Church about 6 stones up from Lincoln Oak Drive. Their gravestones have been restored and will be rededicated at 9.30 am by descendent family members on the occasion of the Centenary. Next, you will travel back down the hill to the Barnitz Family plot. For the Centenary Leona Barnitz' gravestone has been restored and will be dedicated at 9am by Descendent Family Members. The DC Bahá’í archivist who is fundamentally responsible for keeping the most detailed account of the Master's visit to Washington DC and who kept most of the items on display in the DC archives is buried as Leone St. Clair Barnitz. Richard Barnitz, Leona's husband is also buried here. In addition to serving outside the home in the Persian-American Education society and opening their home at 2626 University Place (no longer standing) to the first female university student in America from Persia. They taught their children so well that Minnie Barnitz was able to chant prayers in Arabic in 1910 and were participants together with Beula in the first  Bahá’í children's classes in America. The family's other notable contribution is beginning the tradition of  Bahá’í summer schools in America. Camp Mineola in July and August at Colonial Beach, Virginia, was run by Mrs. Leona Barnitz who taught classes there. During the Master's visit, the Barnitz' hosted some of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s party in their home. Their graves can be found in section G1, and are visible from Woodland Drive at the midpoint and Eastern-bend of that section. Again, look for the Barnitz family stone, beneath which you will find the individual stones.\n\nFort Lincoln Cemetery is steeped in beauty, history and tradition. Chartered in 1912, it was a significant piece of land long before becoming a cemetery. The Old Spring House, the oldest standing structure on the cemetery grounds, was built in 1683 and was used by President Lincoln during the Civil War. From 1510 to 1994, the grounds of Fort Lincoln Cemetery held the Lincoln Oak, a majestic oak tree under which President Abraham Lincoln met with troops during the Civil War of which the Master spoke of at Howard University. The fort, built to serve as an outer defense of the City of Washington, was named in honor of President Abraham Lincoln by general order #10 AOO in September 1861. In 1994, the tree was destroyed by a bolt of lightning. A new white oak tree was planted on the site next to a plaque commemorating the original tree. The Battle of Bladensburg was fought near the Fort Lincoln grounds during the War of 1812, and the Old Dueling Grounds were active on the premises until 1820. You will find statues of all Jesus’ apostles on the grounds, as well as a garden of peace to the north of the Barnitz section.\n",

O, thou Pure Spirit, Amalie Knobloch! Although thou didst soar away from this terrestrial world, yet thou didst enter into the immeasurable, illumined Universe of the Almighty. While in this life thou didst hear the Divine Call, beheld the light of Truth, became alive by the Breaths of the Holy Spirit, tasted the sweetness of the Love of God, became the Maid-Servant of the Lord of Hosts and the object of the Bounties of His Highness the Desired one.\n\nThou didst lead the erring ones into the Path of Truth and bestowed a portion of the Heavenly Food to those who are deprived. Thou didst consecrate the days of thy existence to the Service of His Highness the Clement and spent thy time in the diffusion of the Fragrances of the Paradise of Abha. There are many souls perfumed and many spirits illumined through thy services!\n\nO, thou divine, beloved Maid-Servant! Although thou didst disappear from the mortal eyes, yet thou didst train and educate thy daughters, each of whom has arisen to serve the Kingdom like unto thee and is engaged in the guidance of the souls. In the Assembly of wisdom they are the lighted candles; they sacrifice their lives in the Path of God; they are gardening in thy orchard and irrigating thy rose-garden. Happy is thy condition, for thou art enjoying Eternal Life in the Kingdom of Everlasting Glory and hast left in this world kind and loving Remembrances.\n\nHappy are those souls who visit thy luminous resting-place and through thy commemoration receive and acquire spiritual Powers!\nAn eloquent testimony was made to the life of Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, in the April 1910 issue of the Star of the West, a national Bahá’í newsletter. It announced in three paragraphs the location of the Institution of Bahá’í Sunday Schools (which her daughter Pauline introduced to North America), the integrated Community Feast (which she had personally labored for together with her family as the true pioneers of this work in North America) and finally, a visitation tablet from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, which all Bahá’ís who visit Washington are to read to ensure that her legacy of understanding of Oneness and raising family for Faith and Service live on forever.\n\n\"Regular meetings held Friday evenings at 8:15 and Sunday School at 11:15, at the Gareissen Studio, 1219 Connecticut Avenue.

March 13, Mr. Roy C. Wilhelm was accompanied to the tomb by a party of the young people; March 27 Mr. and Mrs. Kinney, Dr. Fareed and Mrs. Getsinger were visitors, with the Sunday School children completing the party. The obedience of the friends to this command to read the Visiting Tablet, is notable and a great blessing attends this act.\"\n\nHowever the first reading of the tablet was made by her Baha'i Teacher Lua Getsinger on March 27 2010. Lua was affectionately known as our teacher to the Hannens and no doubt other DC Bahá’ís such as Mrs. Parsons and Mr. Gregory. An example of her teachings are found in her April 1905 talk in Washington DC on service:\n“None of us are sufficiently single-minded! We wish to serve in the Cause of God, but we particularly wish to do it in our own way after our own fashion, and when it suits our convenience, and that is just what God won't have. Once engaging in His Service, we must work in accordance with His Way, after His fashion, and when it shall please Him!”\n\n\nLetters from the Master to Mrs. Amalie Knobloch\n\nJuly 1906:\nO thou maid servant of God! Consider not merit and aptitude! Thou shouldst rather consider the favors and benefits of the Blessed perfection.\n\nWhen we think of self, we find that merit and aptitude are lost. When we regard Truth, we discover that the favors of God are infinite and not conditional upon merity and aptitude.\n\nObserve how the small seed grows and thrives by means of vernal showers, the heat of the heavenly sun and the zephyrs until it grows to a fruitful tree. Now see where the former state of the seed is, and the present state of the stem, leaves, blossoms and the wonderful fruits! Consequently the Divine gifts make a sea out of a drop of water! And make out of one seed a heavenly tree.\n\nDecember 1906:\nThis is a great day and this period is the period of the Sovereignty of the Most Glorious Lord. It is the world of illumination and the time of the Manifestation of Mysteries. The Treasury of the Kingdom is visible and the wealth of the realm of Might is attainable. The Everlasting Glory is ready and the Life Eternal is evident and manifest. Now is the time, now is the occasion, when thou mayest guide and educate souls with a shining face, with a heart like unto a Rose-garden; with an exulting mind and nostrils perfumed by the fragrances of the Holy Spirit. This Cause is incommensurable and this gift is resplendent. If thou become assisted therewith the confirmation of the kingdom will uninterruptedly descend upon thee and thou wilt behold clearly and manifestly the Breaths of the Holy Spirit.\n\nAfter her passing, and after the Visitation Tablet which was written in February, March 1910:\n\nThrough the Maid Servants of God, Lua and Mirza Ahmad\n\nTo the friends and maidservants of the Merciful who were assembled together on the 14th of October, 1909, at the memorial service of Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, the one who has ascended to the Kingdom of God.\n\nUpon them be Bahá El Abhá!\n\nHe Is God!\n\nO Thou Almighty! O Thou Forgiver!\n\nThese souls have ascended spiritually to Thy kingdom, are begging Thy Bounty and Favor and are in need of forgiveness and providence.\nO God!\n\nThy Mercy is unlimited and Thy Favor is all-encircling! Immerse Thou these souls in the Ocean of Thy Generosity and Compassion. Shower upon them the Rain of Thy Mystery!\nThou art the Giver! The Generous, the Pardoner and the Clement!\nO ye friends and maid servants of the Merciful!\n\nThank ye God that ye become assisted to be present at the Memorial Service of the Bird of the Rose-garden of Immortality, Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, chanted the supplications, prayed and communed at the threshold of God, pleaded forgiveness for many souls and read Tablets and Heavenly Verses. All the inhabitants of the Kingdom of Abha were made happy thereby and became engaged in mentioning you.\n\nYou must never forget the beloved maid servant of God, Mrs. Amalie Knobloch; always remember her and supplicate for her inexhaustible bounties.\n\nUpon ye be Bahá El Abhá!\n\nMrs. Amalie Knobloch’s chief accomplishments were the raising of three illustrious daughters firmly in the Faith: Fanny, Alma and Pauline. She was German-Lutheran in background, before encountering the Faith through her married daughter Pauline Hannen. Amalie became Bahá’í sometime in late 1905 and after writing her belief to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, received the reply shown on the facing Bahai page addressing Amalie Knobloch on July 25, 1906. Not half a year later ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued guiding this family through its matriarch, addressed to Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, December 9, 1906.\n\nWith her encouragement, all three of her daughters would pioneer to help introduce the faith to other races of people in North America, Africa and Europe. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá in 1910 blessed Mrs. Knobloch with two tablets at her passing from this world. The first tablet if read in her commemoration gives and bestows spiritual Powers to the Faithful, as she did in her lifetime to her daughters, the early D.C. community and indirectly to the world. In the visitation tablet the Master extols \"three lighted candles\", the daughters of Mrs. Amalie Knobloch who are also buried here, adding further blessings to this sacred spot.\n\nFanny Knobloch\nFanny Knobloch was born in Bautzen, Saxony, Germany on December 22, 1859. Fanny Knobloch was taught the faith by her sister Pauline. Pauline taught Fanny the faith in the following way: She would visit her sister with her two sons every Sunday afternoon to discuss the Bahá’í Faith and its interpretation of Bible Scripture. Fanny was sometimes impatient with Pauline and this new religion. One day Pauline came and shared something she had learned from Mirza Abu'l-Fadl about the miracle of the loaves and fishes. The Bahá’í explanation excited Fanny and she attended the meetings from that day on. For two years she studied until she became a Bahá’í in 1904. She then became an eager and ardent teacher of the Faith.\n\nIn 1908 the three sisters and Joseph made an inspiring pilgrimage to Akka to see‘Abdu’l-Bahá. Fanny described Akka this way, \"In our small hotel we occupied a second floor room, one door of which opened on to a small balcony. That night the glorious rays of a full moon revealed the white crested waves of the sea, rolling upon the sands of the valley of Akka. The minaret of the mosque gleamed white above the wall of the Prison City. In the distance was Mt. Carmel, illumined, while close at hand great rows of tall palms cast weird shadows upon the road.\"\n\nShe loved the Holy family. She met Munirih Khanum, the wife of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the young Shoghi Effendi. She described meeting Bahíyyih Khánum who is ‘Abdu’l-Bahá's sister. \"A strange and unknown feeling possessed me while in the presence of Bahíyyih Khánum, the greatest Holy Leaf. Possibly it can be described as a feeling of awe, a feeling very unfamiliar to me. However, later, I realized that I had been in the presence of the greatest, the most holy woman in the history of the world, the Greatest Holy Leaf! The daughter of the Manifestation of God, Bahá’u’lláh.\"\n\nThey stayed nine days in Akka. When they left they wept. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá said, \"You are weeping? Do not weep! Many friends weep because they wish to remain longer.\"\n\nFannie said, \"No, we have received so many blessings and are eager to go out and share them with all who are ready to listen.\"\n\n‘Abdu’l-Bahá smiled and said, \"If you but knew the value of these days, you would not eat, you would not sleep, you would not walk. You would run and give all the Glad Tidings.\"\n\nOn the way home they visited Mirza Abu’l-Fadl in Cairo. He was their dear and beloved teacher in Washington, D.C. He gave Fannie a gift of his prayer beads which he said he received from 'Abdu'l-Baha.\n\nAt home they continued the work that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had inspired them to do. They worked hard for racial unity within the Bahá’í community.\n\nBy 1909, in Washington DC, Lua Getsinger, the Hannens and Fannys sisters Alma and Pauline, all of whom were well aware of the implications of racial unity in the Bahá’í\n teachings, were already participating in integrated meetings, both in public places and in private homes. On April 9 1910, the first ever nineteen day feast, where both races were united was held with Fanny Knobloch acting as hostess and the speaker was Louis Gregory. Joseph Hannen described it in Bahá’í News as wonderfully blessed and successful and noted that several leading men and women of the colored race attended. After teaching in DC in the early 1900s, she was soon off pioneering in 1920 and instrumental to the opening of the South African nation to the Faith of Bahá’u’lláh. The same year the ANC was born in South Africa, the first two native South Africans, Mr. And Mrs. William Fraetas became Bahá’ís in New York in 1912 upon hearing ‘Abdu’l-Bahá speak. Miss Fanny Knobloch settled in Cape Town during 1920, where England's Agnes Cook had initiated the faith 9 years earlier. The fruits of her labor, assisted occasionally by her sister Pauline Hannen from Washington D.C. and the historic assistance of Martha Root, resulted in 3 small groups of Bahá’ís in the Western Cape and 3 more in and around Johannesburg by 1929. The very first local Bahá’í Assembly was formed in Pretoria in 1925. Fanny came home once in 1928 because of illness, but returned at the age of sixty-eight to remain for two more years. Finally, the difficulties of old age forced her to return to the United States where she lived with her nephew, Carl Hannen and then in a nursing home. She was often in great pain. She died on Dec. 9, 1949. She was the first born of Mrs. Amalie Knobloch and the last to die.\n\nShoghi Effendi paid tribute to Fanny Knobloch at her passing some 25 years later on December 16, 1950:\n\nGrieve at the passing of beloved, distinguished, exemplary pioneer of Faith, Fanny Knobloch. Memory of her notable services imperishable, her reward in Abhá Kingdom bountiful, assured, everlasting.\"\n\nFanny Knobloch was buried in Prospect Hills Cemetery in Washington D.C. after she passed away in 1949. In 1930 she and her sister Alma lived at 624 23rd Street NW, which was being torn down during the family's reunion at her gravesite in July 2000.\n\nPauline Knobloch Hannen\nPauline was born on August 29, 1874 in Washington DC and raised in the American South, particularly in Wilmington, North Carolina. During her upbringing, Pauline became painfully aware of the racial crimes that were commonly committed by whites on Negroes. She was destined to go on and be a pioneer in removing America’s racial problems by spreading Bahá’u’lláh‘s teachings amongst both races. She married Joseph Hannen on November 8, 1893 and she gave birth to two sons -  Carl in 1895 and Paul in 1900. She also gave birth to a Bahá’í family through Carl, which is now six generations Bahá’í in America, land likely the oldest successively Baha'i Family in the nation.\n\nPauline (Knobloch) Hannen was the First Believer of an illustrious line of Bahá’í\n Servants, and a ground-breaking prime mover behind the teaching of the African-Descent Americans in Washington D.C. She also participated in important travel-teaching to South Africa while that community was still in its infancy.\n\nMirza Abu’l-Fadl and Ali Kuli Khan had moved in 1902 to a house between Scott Circle and Thirteenth Street on Massachusetts Avenue, where Mirza had rooms on the second floor. Mrs. Hannen would come upstairs in 1902 to be taught the Bahá’í Faith, leaving her baby in its carriage downstairs, outside the front door! (innocent days, those!) She visited a number of times, and sat quietly while Mirza explained the Bible prophecies about the coming of the Lord. She just sat and listened, accepted a cup of tea from Mirza's hands, waited until they were done speaking, and then said goodbye, went back downstairs and pushed the baby home. She came back day after day continuing this same routine.\n\nOne day Khan said to Mirza, “Does this little girl understand what we are talking about? Is she really interested?” They both decided that since she kept coming back, she must be interested, although she said nothing. Impatient, Khan made up his mind to find out for himself whether she was receiving the Message or not. On her next visit he simply asked her, was she satisfied with the explanations or did she need more answers to become convinced? She suddenly beamed at them. “How could there be anything more wonderful than this great Faith?” she said. “After you have received this, what else in the world would you wish to possess?”\n\nAs was the custom Pauline wrote to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá declaring her Faith, and ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s reply was translated by Ali Kuli Khan in May 1903 as read on the Bahá’í page.\n\nThis remarkable women, with courage and conviction took the Faith to her devoted Lutheran family and husband. She and her husband and family served the Cause all through their lives. The continuing progress of her teaching won her ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s favor, He wrote her again in 1908 shortly before she went on Pilgrimage. They went on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1909. Not only did she bring the Knoblochs (her 2 sisters and mother) and Joseph (her husband) into the faith but her relatives, the Barnitz family of Washington D.C. as well. Two of her most outstanding accomplishments were the introduction of the Faith to Louis Gregory and Mrs. Pocahontas Pope both among the first of their respective races to become Bahá’í in America.\n\nPauline Hannens most important contribution to the Washington community was made in her special pioneering effort to teach African-Descent Americans. Amidst the completely segregated Washington DC (in 1912 there was but one restaurant which would serve both races together and the owners were foreigners), she and her husband Joseph, opened their home to African-Descent Americans in a hope to pass them the message of Unity and Oneness of the Bahá’í Faith. With limited writings from the Faith, they well understood the spirit of this principle and motive force of the Faith of God in this age.\n\nOne Book of guidance they did have was the Hidden Words of Bahá’u’lláh, in which it is written: O children of men! Know ye not why We created you all from the same dust? That no one should exalt himself over the other...Since We have created you all from one same substance it is incumbent on you to be even as one soul, to walk with the same feet, eat with the same mouth and dwell in the same land, that from your innermost being, by your deeds and actions, the signs of oneness and the essence of detachment may be made manifest.\n\nPaulines story of awakening to the teaching of African-Descent Americans is as remarkable as her learning the Bahai Faith. Pauline bent down and tied an African-Descent American woman’s untied shoelace. Pauline said the woman was astonished and all the people who saw thought she must be crazy. This small but important event was a turning point for Pauline and it was then that she decided to turn her teaching efforts towards the African-Descent Americans. She began teaching by telling her black washer woman Miss Carrie York who accepted the Faith very quickly. Pauline also told her sisters seamstress, Pocahontas Pope, who was also black skinned, and Pope too accepted the New Cause. First these two women held meetings at their homes to introduce the Faith to their black friends in hopes that they too would accept the Faith as they had. Then this was the time the Hannens did the daring act of letting the blacks into their own home. Their bravery was rewarded, for by July 1908 fifteen African-Descent Americans had become Bahá’ís in Washington D.C.\n\nIt was through their tireless efforts, such as teaching Hand of the Cause of God, Louis Gregory continuously for 18 months which nurtured him into the faith, and caused him to speak very highly of Pauline. Louis’ writing expresses Pauline's love, leadership and wisdom in Teaching the African-Descent American population:\n\nDescribing his first Bahá’í meeting he states: The only occupant of the room when I entered was Mrs. Pauline Hannen. She gave me an unusually cordial welcome... told me that I would hear something very wonderful, though difficult. It would afford me an opportunity similar to that which would have been mine had I lived on earth as a contemporary of Jesus Christ. She urged me to get a full understanding of the message of today, that through it a work would be possible that would bless humanity. She kindly gave me three pieces of Bahá’í literature, the Hidden Words, Dealy Book and a small tract written by Charles Mason Remey....Mrs. Hannen invited me to another meeting. It was held at the home of the two colored friends [Miss Millie York and Miss Nellie Gray], among poor people. Mrs. Hannen was the teacher and her loving service was impressive. She then invited me to come to her home where I would meet either herself or her husband for further teaching. Mr. Joseph H. Hannen thus became my teacher, a service in which he was aided by his wife. Over a period of more than eighteen months I went to their home on Sunday evenings...During this period Mr. And Mrs. Hannen went on their pilgrimage to the Holy Land. As they were my sole connection with the Faith, my interest waned during their absence. A long time afterwards I learned that they had kindly mentioned me to the Master who had instructed them to continue teaching me, assuring them that I would become a believer and an advocate of the teachings. Upon their return they remade the connection. Through the very unusual kindness of these dear friends my mental veils were cleared away and the light of assurance mercifully appeared within when they had taught me the Greatest Name and how to pray. I became a confirmed believer about June, 1909 and thereafter cooperated with the Hannens in arranging meetings and trying to give everyone the message....Misses Alma and Fanny Knobloch with Mr. And Mrs. Hannen were pioneers in the early days in spreading the message among the colored people of Washington. Among those they were the means of bringing to the attitude of acceptance were Misses York and Gray, Mrs. Pocahontas Pope and Mrs. Rhoda Turner...During my early days of investigation I rarely attended a meeting but went to the home of the Hannens where my friends and I were always welcome.\n\nWith Louis in the Faith, Pauline was able to work with him as a member of the race amity committee. The committee would organize meetings and activities primarily for the purpose of having different races in the same place at the same time.\n\nLouis Gregory wrote of them in Bahá’í World volume 8,\n\n\"These two rare souls were united in service, teaching every rank, color, class and creed, amid rural scenes and in many cities, in Washington, where they resided, from the lowly prisoners in jail to the social leaders. How healing to the sick; how consoling to the distressed; how enlightening to children and to those of mature years; how harmonizing an influence; how self-sacrificing; how ceaselessly active! Their Southern origin, freedom from prejudice, warmth of heart and knowledge of the Word of God, admirably fitted them for the stupendous and glorious task of harmonizing the races, assigned to them by the Master. They visited ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and the Holy Shrines in 1909.\"\n\nPaulines contribution to the Washington DC community did not stop with Race Unity. Pauline also had a love for children and youth. It was for this reason she began Bahá’í Sunday school classes. After a short time she was able to have the two interests mix, to begin having racially integrated children, youth, and adult classes. Pauline had received items for teaching children during their pilgrimage to ‘Akká in 1909. Pauline also became chairwomen of a committee for the collection, organization and distribution of all material pertaining to the education of children within the USA Bahá’í community.\n\nMr. And Mrs. Hannen will be considered the parents of the Bahá’í Sunday school idea in America. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote to Pauline concerning the Sunday school classes. He told her to put great importance on the classes so day by day its circle may be enlarged. What he meant was that he wanted the classes to become more well known, assuring her that it would have great results. With confidence in what ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told her she continued with fervor and determination. Because of Pauline’s work, the Washington DC Sunday school classes were the best organized in America between 1900-1912. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá wrote, \"Indeed the sweet melody of the pupils of Mrs. Hannen gladdened the hearts of the people of the Supreme Concourse.\"\n\nPauline Hannen was buried in Prospect Hills Cemetery in Washington D.C. after she passed away in 1939.\n\nThe year before Joseph passed on to the next Kingdom, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sang the praises of Pauline and Joseph:\n\nO ye two heralds of the Divine Kingdom! Verily ye have consecrated your time and your lives to the service of the Kingdom. Day and night, your highest wish is confined to the guidance of people and praise be to God, ye are confirmed and assisted in the promulgation of Divine Teachings. This supreme favor is pregnant with momentous results and this seed which ye have sown in the garden of Reality shall yield an exuberant result. Every seed shall yield a teeming harvest and every bough shall turn into a thriving, fruitful tree.\n\nAlma Knobloch\n\nOn July 31 1912 at Mrs. Parson's summer house in Dublin Maine, the Master told a story of Alma: \"Anyone whom I send to a place is confirmed; anyone. One of them is Miss Alma Knobloch. God has confirmed her. In the beginning she was teaching in Stuttgart. Now she is in Leipzig.\" This story would be repeated by the Master in a Tablet He revealed for all the Believers in the United States and Canada, on April 11 1916: \"Likewise Miss Knobloch traveled alone to Germany. To what a great extent she became confirmed!\" This was followed with one of the Master's most quoted statements \"Therefore, know ye of a certainty that whosoever arises in this day to diffuse the divine fragrances, the cohorts of the Kingdom of God shall confirm him and the bestowals and the favors of the Blessed Perfection shall encircle him. O that I could travel, even though on foot and in the utmost poverty, to these regions, and, raising the call of \"Yá Bahá’u’l-Abhá\" in cities, villages, mountains, deserts and oceans, promote the divine teachings! This, alas, I cannot do. How intensely I deplore it! Please God, ye may achieve it.\"\nThe Master's Grandson Shoghi Effendi immortalized Alma in his history of the Baha'i Faith God Passes By: \"Alma Knobloch . . . hoisted the standard of the Faith in Germany, and carried its light to Austria.\" At the request of‘Abdu’l-Bahá, she pioneered to Germany in 1907. One of the great early teachers of the Faith in Europe, she helped to bring the Hand of the Cause Hermann Grossman into the Faith, as explained in \"Hermann Grossman, Hand of the Cause of God, A Life for the Faith.\"\nAlma Knobloch became a Bahá’í in 1903 with her sisters, Pauline and Fanny and her mother, Amalie Knobloch. The family became a lighted torch in the Washington DC area and then they carried the torch throughout the world. Alma Knobloch was the Faith’s first female to pioneer from Washington DC and to teach the cause beyond the United States. Because of Fanny's generosity, her sister, Alma was able to pioneer in Germany from 1907 until 1920. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had sent two letters before she left encouraging her pioneering decision.\n\nAlma left for Germany in July 1907. Alma was welcomed in Stuttgart and invited to homes where afternoon and evening events were exciting gatherings for Bahá’í and non-Bahá’í as well. In the Bahá’í World Volume 9, it says that, \"Alma worked incessantly, always effacing her own strong personality and accenting the Spirit of Bahá’u’lláh.\"\n\nMany young people became Bahá’ís, formed study groups, and began to correspond with the Holy Family in the Holy Land. Local Spiritual Assemblies were formed in Stuttgart, Esslingen, Zuffenhausen, Leipzig and Gera.  ‘Abdu’l-Bahá encouraged the translation of the Writings into German and the Bahá’ís waited eagerly for each new publication. Concerts and assemblies were held where the highlight of the evening was a speaker who introduced the Faith which grew steadily.\n\nJust as she co-pioneered racial unity in North America, she did so too in Europe, when she greeted her sisters D.C. friend Louis Gregory shortly after his pilgrimage to the Holy Land in 1911. At ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s request Mr. Gregory visited Germany in April 1911 after his pilgrimage. The German Bahá’í community had been established only a few years earlier. It had grown largely through the efforts of Miss Alma Knobloch, who had settled in Stuttgart in 1907. Miss Knobloch assured his welcome in a land where non-European minorities were few and where, scarcely more than twenty years later, racialism, which Shoghi Effendi has termed one of the chief idols in the desecrated temple of mankind, was to be enshrined by the Nazis in their country’s political philosophy. The German Bahá’ís lovingly welcomed Mr. Gregory and held a reception in his honor where he, in their words \"told the assembled friends much that was interesting.\"\n\nWhen war was declared in 1914 Alma stayed and suffered with her German brothers and sisters. Before Alma returned to the United States, she visited Austria, Switzerland, London and Paris. She taught wherever she went and wrote letters to all her spiritual children.\n\nShoghi Effendi provides a beautiful testimonial to Alma's work in the Bahá’í history God Passes By: Simultaneously, travelers and teachers, emerging triumphantly from the storms of tests and trials which had threatened to engulf their beloved Cause, arose, of their own accord, to reinforce and multiply the strongholds of the Faith already established. Centers were opened in the cities of Washington... and in other places. Audacious pioneers, whether as visitors or settlers, eager to spread the new born Evangel beyond the confines of their native country, undertook journeys, and embarked on enterprises which carried its light to the heart of Europe, to the Far East, and as far as the islands of the Pacific. [Washington D.C. resident]... Alma Knobloch, following on the heels of Dr. K. E. Fisher, hoisted the standard of the Faith in Germany, and carried its light to Austria.\n\nAlma Knobloch was buried in Prospect Hills Cemetery in Washington D.C. after she passed away on December 22, 1943.\n\nEmail Date: Thursday, June 29, 2000 1:24 PM\nSubject: Knobloch Family Memorial\n\n\"You are invited to a unique event that will pay tribute to a distinguished Bahá’í family of Washington DC, the Knobloch family.\n\nPauline Knobloch was the first of the family to become a Bahá’í (in 1903), followed by her mother Amalie and her sisters Fanny and Alma. Pauline's husband, the saintly Joseph Hannen, took notes of all ‘Abdu’l-Bahá talks in Washington. It was through this devoted couple that Louis Gregory became a Bahá’í, studying with them each week in their modest home.\n\nFanny was the first Bahá’í teacher to go to South Africa, where she stayed for three years developing the first Bahá’í settlements. She returned to the US because of ill health but later, at age 68, returned to South Africa. She lived her life out at the home of Carl Hannen in Willmette.\n\nAlma Knobloch went to Germany in 1907 to implant the Bahá’í Faith there. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá instructed her to remain as long as she could and she was there through the horrors of the first world war and beyond.\n\nThis family is buried in a family plot at Prospect Hill cemetery just north of Rhode Island venue and North Capitol Street in Washington, and about 20 of the descendants are flying in to hold a commemorative ceremony there on July 8th at 11 am. You are all invited to attend, and to come for a light lunch at the Bahá’í Center to meet the descendants of this outstanding family.\nPlease join us on this occasion.\n\nThe Spiritual Assembly of Washington DC\"\n\nTo find the gravesite, follow the cemetery outer circle road to the right to its Southern most point before it turns back into the cemetery. From there you will walk in and look for the Grey stone with Hannen on one side, Knobloch on the other, and the 9 pointed Bahá’í Star above them both. The Hannen family planted at a bush beside the gravestone in 2000, which is about waist high now, to help guide you to the spot and shelter the dear family.\n\nDr. Ardeshir B. Irani and his wife Mrs. Louise Shuman Irani\n\nNext to the Knobloch\/Hannen Gravesite is another founding Washington DC Bahá’í family's gravesite. Ms. Louise Shuman served on the first Washington DC Bahá’í Local Spiritual Assembly in 1907. The son of the famous founder of Indian Cinema Ardeshir Irani came to Washington to study to become a doctor, and ended up marrying Ms. Louise Shuman. Mr. Irani received six tablets from ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, and was affectionately referred to as the \"Tiger.\" Their daughter Tahmineh Irani served the Bahá’í  Faith till her passing in 2010 in the Washington DC area. She arranged for her husband Lieut. George Ragsdale Parsons to have the only gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery (\"America's Shrine\") to have the Greatest Name inscribed upon the headstone in Section 7, Site 8287-2, where she too is now buried.\n",

              "Welcome to Rock Creek Cemetery, at 10 Rock Creek Church Rd, where you can find the tombs of Ali Kuli Khan and Stanwood Cobb, who are buried amongst a section of Bahá’í\nGraves. To reach the grave stones, first enter the cemetery at the main gate, proceed down hill to the intersection of six roads, continue almost straight proceeding at 11 o’clock if we take it that you entered the intersection from 6 o’ clock looking down at a clock dial. Take your first left. Stay on that road until you enter another intersection of 4 roads. Proceed straight through that road, take your first right and park your car. There you will see a lone tree in the middle of the cemetery field. That tree stands over the granite grave of Ali Kuli Khan. Mr. Cobb's Copper Grave is nearby in the plain sun.\n\nAli Kuli Khan\n\nAli Kuli Khan was energetic, able, hardworking, and one of the best informed of Bahá’í\nteachers. He lived to be almost ninety. Many years earlier, in 1895, the well known Bahá’í\narchitect, Ustad Hasan, opened his house in Tehran, at great peril, to teach the Faith day and night. His brother-in-law was an amateur wrestler which brought him into contact with the rich and worldly crowd. The young Ali Kuli Khan socialized with with this  crowd at a place called the Zur-Khanih or The House of Strength. As Khan watched his brother and friends become Bahá’ís, he wished to go to Ustad’s meetings to expose these teachings as false superstitions and return his friends to their previous mode of life.\n\nOne night he spoke up to the two great Bahá’í teachers, Nayyir and his brother, Sina. \"Is it fair\", he asked them, \" to invite me here and talk to me hour after hour, and then, for a reward, to give me, at midnight, a small portion of meat and rice?\"\n\nThe gentle answer was that he would soon understand he was receiving not earthly food but a heavenly feast as his reward for his patience.\n\nOne night, after several months, as Khan used to tell it, the teachers suddenly began to make sense. He thought it must have been the teachers' prayers that finally made him a Bahá’í. They said that the Bahá’í principles were the only hope for Persia’s regeneration and also for the regeneration of the entire world.\n\nKhan rose up, took the teachers in his arms, and wept, both in  joy and despair. How, he wanted to know, weak as he was, could he ever use what he had to serve Bahá’u’lláh? Their answer was that the Manifestation of God would give him the strength so that he would abandon his old ways and become a successful servant in His Cause.\n\nGiving up what would have been a distinguished career in Persia, Khan dedicated his life to the faith. Khan described that night as his resurrection from the dead. Khan's conversion took place around 1895, whereafter Khan offered himself to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá as a translator and interpreter. Ali Kuli Khan’s role as a translator came at the especially opportune moment when The Sacred Writings had to be translated into English, because of the Holy Cause just having reached America.\n\nAside from translating, Ali Kuli Khan was also a very effective teacher of The Faith. In America his most famous students were the Hannens in DC. While in Persia he converted the son-in-law of the reigning Shah, Ihtisham-i-Dawlih. The Master sent Khan a Tablet in Arabic at the time of the prince's declaration, with the prophecy that Khan would be of future service to the Cause throughout the world.\n\nThereafter, he made his way on pilgrimage to Akka in the Spring of 1899. Khan met‘Abdu’l-Bahá, who spoke to him words which ever-after would resound in Khan’s heart and mind:\n\n\"The Blessed Perfection, Bahá’u’lláh, has promised to raise up souls who would hasten to the service of the Covenant, and would assist me in spreading His Faith. His Cause has now reached America and many in the Western world are being attracted to His Teachings. You, with your knowledge of English, are one of these souls promised by Bahá’u’lláh. You have come to assist me by translating His Sacred Writings as well as my letters to the friends in America and elsewhere in the West.\"\n\nAfter his pilgrimage, Khan stayed on in the Holy Land serving as a translator, which brought Khan into contact with Pilgrims. In 1899 he had the totally new experience of meeting Occidental Bahá’ís. One of those who came to see ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  as a pilgrim from the United States was Mrs. Charlotte Emilie Brittingham Dixon, founder of the Washington, DC Bahá’í community. She was accompanied by her sister and her two daughters, Louise and Elanor. Khan had never seen an American family before. When in the following year, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and also Khan to Washington DC to write a book called Bahá’í Proofs, Khan became close friends with the same Dixon family he met on their pilgrimage.\n\nOne day in 1900 the Master looked at Khan with a wonderful, loving expression in His eyes and, smiling tenderly, He said, \"You cannot conceive what power is going to be yours in the future when you speak of the Faith. Forget your present difficulty. The day will come when, without any preparation, you will speak to large gatherings. The more numerous the people, the better you will speak. You will deliver the Message to hundreds, to thousands, no, to millions!\"\n\nKhan's Muslim mother wished Khan to return home and establish his career like the rest of his family. The Master replied lovingly, \"Write your mother and tell her you will surely return at a future time, when your coming will rejoice her heart. But you should also make it known to her', the Master said, 'that now you are about to be sent on a long journey, to a far away country where you will do a great work that will bring you fame, for it will identify you with a great Cause, a Cause devoted to the welfare of all humankind. You will come back to her in a matter of years, tell her, when your name and fame will confer blessings upon her and on all the family.\"\n\nOne morning thereafter in Haifa, in the year 1900 ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for Khan to meet Him at a little house on the German Colony street. He told Khan that two American ladies had arrived from Paris and were staying at the German hotel near the sea.  Khan was to call on them and escort them to the house. One of the two cousins, Elsa Barney, was from Washington DC, further strengthening his connection to that city. Khan had begun to hear that by special request of Elsa (Laura) Barney of Washington DC, the Master had agreed to send Mirza Abu’l-Fadl to America to unfold the true teachings of Bahá’u’lláh\nand interpret the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures, the key to which Mirza had found in the Book of Iqan.\n\nTo console Khan on his coming journey the Master said :\n\n\"I will be with you at all times. You must go forth now and give to others the bounties that have been given to you here.\"\n\nThe Master had taught Khan all he needed for service in the wide field that was America, a land chosen by God, inhabited by a people whose mission it was to establish peace and justice throughout the world. This would be a great service for Khan to render, and also a great opportunity, for he would be living in intimate association with a man of unbounded faith, of great erudition. In such company he would be even better prepared for his task.\n\nBy May 26 of 1901 Ali Kuli Khan had reached Paris. In June of 1901 he finally arrived in America, in New York. In December 1901, Ali Kuli Khan received a telegram from Miss Barney that she had engaged quarters for him and Mirza Abu’l-Fadl in Washington DC.\n\nTheir Washington DC address was in a red brick boarding house on De Sales Street, between 17th street and Connecticut Avenue. Years after, the Mayflower Hotel was built there. Bahá’ís would call on Mirza by turn, and several times a week public meetings were held at the old Corcoran Building, opposite the Treasury Department on 15th Street. Apart from meeting Washingtonians, Abu'l-Fadl's instructions from the Master were to begin by writing his book, The Bahá’í Proofs, with Khan translating whatever was written each day. Mirza wrote in Arabic, in a style and depth which he alone could command. In addition to all the other work, they held a class for seekers each afternoon at three.\n\nMirza, like Khan, loved Washington. The quiet, the sunshine, the flowering spring times, the inviting parks. The two of them were familiar figures in the North Western section of the city: Mirza, old, with his patriarchal beard, white turban and flowing robes; Khan, young, in his carefully selected Western dress.\n\nKhan was a sacrifice by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, of his best translator. The work of Abdu’l-Fadl and the American believers, bore its brightest fruit, in the April 1902 publication in New York of \"The Bahá’í\n Proofs.\" The copyright was owned by A.P. Barney of Washington DC, who was Elsa’s mother, Alice Pike Barney. Its long-term importance is indicated by its reprinting, with its 2nd edition in 1914, 3rd in 1929 and  4th in 1983.\n\nIn his capacity as the foremost translator in the West, Khan was able to share with the Washington D.C. Bahá’ís the unique influence of having all of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s correspondence with the believers passed through his mind and hand. Every week, Khan was brought a large packet of Tablets from the Master, sent by Him in response to many letters from America. Khan had to start work at six in the morning to translate these Tablets and get each one ready for mailing with a covering letter from himself.\n\nFor instance, about two years later, in 1903, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá revealed a message, then famous in America, called by American Bahá’ís \"The Purity Tablet\":\n\n\"O Friends of the Pure and Omnipotent God!...although bodily cleanliness is a physical thing, it hath, nevertheless, a powerful influence on the life of the spirit.”\n\nKhan also worked on The Seven Valleys, the Tarazat series of Tablets, and the Kitáb-i-Íqán which was later published in New York by George Blackburne Co. in 1904. All of these works were under the direction of the Master.\n\nKhan also received a great deal of mail, sometimes hundreds of letters, from American Bahá’ís, asking him questions to present to Mirza. He would then translate and mail back the answers.\n\nThese strong language skills, helped Khan gravitate to the Persian Legation. The Persian Minister to the United States, Ishaq Khan, arrived in Washington the same year as Mirza Abu’l-Fadl and Khan, in 1901. He was a General, a title bestowed on him by the Shah. Later on, the Shah made him a Prince. A distinguished man, he was also tolerant of other people’s religions. Before his Washington post he had been Persia’s Minister-Resident at Cairo and there, had become a friend of Abu’l-Fadl.\n\nIshaq Khan knew French but not English, and asked Khan to serve at the Persian legation and also to be his personal secretary. Khan told him that he had heavy responsibilities as a Bahá’í translator and had been sent to America by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá to translate Mirza’s teaching and also the important book that Mirza was writing.\n\nAt this point Mirza interrupted and said that the two of them would write to the master at ‘Akká, explaining the situation and saying how kind the Minister had been to the Bahá’ís in Cairo. The Master replied that it would be well for Khan to assist the Minister, providing he could spare the time from his Bahá’í duties.\n\nThat was how Khan came to assume his life in the Persian Government in Washington, D.C.\n\nHis first term in Washington D.C. would not last long. Muzaffarid-Din Shah, was ailing, and the incipient revolution was growing, but still at an early stage. What the leaders of Persia wanted badly were Persians with experience of the Western world. Khan was the only young Persian who had spent several years in America and had made a name for himself while introducing his country to the United States.\n\nAlso important was his marriage to an American, a young woman of distinction, for, among other considerations, it had been widely publicized in America, noted in the European press, and word of it spread in Persia. Friends and relatives at home, who had lamented his abandoning them to teach the Bahá’í Faith, were now ready to forget and forgive if he would take on a new role and work to promote a constitutional government.\n\nThis recall to Persia, afforded him a chance to make a pilgrimage. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, himself in prison, encouraged Khan, when Khan and Florence visited in 1906. “These poison-bitter days will pass on by, And once again will life be sugar-sweet. All will be well,” he said.” A time is coming when pilgrims from every land will extend from the ‘Akká Gate all the way to the Shrine in one unbroken stream. People from every region of the world will come to visit this consecrated Spot.\n\nAt another dinner, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá told them this prophecy of the Bahá’í Faith in America: He mentioned a believer of whom He said,” She is very brave, very firm. She writes that on a teaching trip, a band of children ran after her in the street, and called out insults and mocked and made fun of her. She said this gave her joy, because it befell her on the pathway of God. Regarding this, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá continued,  “In America, certain men will appear, wielding the power of religion, and they will rise up against the Cause and will try to keep the people from approaching this Truth. When this comes to pass, the Cause will advance, and among the believers there will be an increase of radiance and joy.”\n\nIn another afternoon, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá sent for Khan and asked for news of the Faith in various leading cities of America. Later, Khan delivered a message to‘Abdu’l-Bahá a from The Bahá’í Publishing Society of Chicago. To this ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied, “The Assemblies of Chicago, Washington and New York must be in agreement with each other as to their publications. When one of these Assemblies plans to publish, it should see to it that the Publishing Societies of the other cities are first notified, so as to forestall any occasion for inharmony.”\n\nThe Master, speaking of the early stages of the Cause in America, told Khan: That which always brings about inharmony and slows the progress of the Faith is self-interest, the love of leadership. Those who have such tendencies imagine that they can be concealed from the others. They do not understand that, sooner or later, whatever your qualities may be, praiseworthy or objectionable, they cannot possibly not become known to the rest. If hidden today, the quality will be exposed tomorrow. And if an individual does not possess a certain good quality, he cannot persuade others that he has it, simply by dint of proclaiming that he has. What favors the progress of a soul is humility, meekness, selflessness. Every individual must suppose every other to be gifted in a way which he himself is not, to have some gift of which he is deprived. This will put each one in a position of lowliness relative to the others. One must not think of becoming a leader of men. If one imagines that he has this or that excellent quality, and has superior powers not possessed by the others, this will fill him with pride. But when each regards the next person as having excellent gifts, and therefore defers to him, by this means, each and all will be humble, and the love of leadership will vanish away. This will conduce to the progress of each individual and of the Cause of God. But the one who lives to lead will suffer deprivation in the end, and will never succeed in serving the Cause.\n\nWashington Times, February 5, 1908:\nMira Ali-Kuli, the Persian lecturer is here. He comes straight from the hothouse atmosphere of Boston culture, but about him there still clings the breath of the wild rose and in his vest pocket is the intoxicating perfume of the gardens of Persia. There, let no man heed the rumble of the distant drum. Rather, let all approach in reverence the red room of the Willard Hotel Friday night, when Mira Ali-Kuli will discourse profoundly on The Real Omar Khayyam, the Persian who lowered the drinking of wine to the level of mere genus...The lecturer will explain in excellent English what old Omar meant...He has been a deep student of Omar, Persia, and the Bahá’í movement, which is striving for universal peace and the brotherhood of man. He lectures on subjects other than those dealing with the Persian who cried out for a jug in the wilderness. He talks on mystic teachings, the immortality of the soul, predestination and free will, Emerson and Carlyle, and the doctrine of unity. ( Arches Of the Years, pg. 39.)\n\nKhan also lectured in Washington under the patronage of Mrs. Parsons, French Ambassador and Madame Jusserand, Senator and Mrs. Henry Cabot Lodge, and the president of George Washington University, Dr. Charles W. Needham. Khan was granted an appointment as Chargé d'affaires at Washington. This document was signed by the Regent, Abdul-Mulk. A Chargé d'affaires carries out the same duties and has the same privileges as an Ambassador when such an official is absent or not appointed. He arrived back from Persia on August 17th, 1910. The Washington Star, August 21st, gives the ages of Khan’s nephews he brought with him as 15, 14 and 10.\n\nThe Washington Herald, September 4, 1910, welcomed Khan to the city: The appointment of Mirza Ali-Kuli Khan as Persian Chargé d'affaires here is another gratifying return of an old friend. He has been absent in Persia for eight months...presented his credentials as Chargé d'affaires to Acting Secretary of State Huntington Wilson Thursday.\n\nThe famous, W. Morgan Shuster was chosen by Khan to bring order out of the chaos of Persia’s finances. In December 1910, Khan applied to the United States Government for financial experts and approved W. Morgan Shuster, recommended by President Taft as Treasurer-General. Shuster and several colleagues sailed from New York on April 8, 1911. Some weeks after arriving, Shuster learned that the Americans were thought to be Bahá’ís, come not to reform the finances but to proselytize, and that his own fifteen very efficient locally-hired servants were Bahá’ís. He was called in by the Minister of Finance and asked to discharge his servants, as they were all Bahá’ís. Shuster says this was news to him... I told the Finance Minister that the Americans were not Bahá’í but that I did not propose to have the Persian Government or people pass on the religious faith of ourselves, or our servants, or the color of our neckties.\n\nAli Kuli Khan would spend the next year so busy in his new official capacities that he had to miss ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s third visit to DC in November while he was in Alberta, Canada. However, with both the Turkish, Persian, British, Dutch and Swiss delegations to Washington, he was no doubt instrumental in gaining the Bahá’í Faith a hearing in these circles of society. Of Ali Kuli Khan, it can truly be said that he labored quietly, unremittingly for the Bahá’í Faith throughout the country and world even while serving the community of Washington D.C. itself.\n\nKhan, left Washington for a while, after the Masters visit, but was to return. Khan became Persia's ambassador to Turkey and Southern Russia. Khan also represented his native land at the Versailles Peace Conference after World War I. Khan and his Muslim niece, who helped care for him, took up residence in 1950s close to Rock Creek Park, overlooking treetops and an Islamic minaret puncturing the Washington sky in the distance. Nearly every afternoon through 1954 and 1955 Khan could be seen crossing the Connecticut Avenue Bridge close to his home. He always had his hands folded behind him, and often as we stood at the railings-- he wept openly, remembering Florence, his recently deceased American wife, a woman, he said, who had been not just beautiful, but wise. Khan, lived fifty years of Bahá’í\nHistory in Washington D.C. from its very birth. Khan’s daughters Hamideh and Marzieh survived him, and Marzieh published an outstanding biography of her Father and Mother published by George Ronald.\n\nStanwood Cobb\nStanwood Cobb was born on November 6, 1881, into a family of love and spiritual earnestness, evidenced by the Boston Post writing as its banner headline on the day after his father's passing, \"DARIUS COBB - The Best Loved Man in Boston- has passed away.\" At the age of two Stanwood was so sick with double pneumonia that the Doctor left at 6pm stating he would die that night. His mother prayed to God that Stanwood's life be spared so it may be dedicated to His service. As a child he adored contact with nature. He hiked almost 5 miles a day until the age of 37. He skipped grades again and again first, third, and seventh, which resulted in him becoming socially out of his depth, even as he intellectually continued to be challenged. He arose to Harvard Divinity School in 1905, after finishing as Valedictorian at Dartmouth college.\n\nWhile studying at Harvard Divinity School to become a Unitarian clergyman, Stanwood was meditating on how to convert the entire world to a beautiful way of living. He reasoned that \"someone must arise claiming more than human authority, and deliver such a Plan. Then it will be followed.\" Two months later, Stanwood found himself at Green Acre, Maine, looking into the Green Acre Summer School of Comparative Religion which he had been reading about in the Boston Transcript for which he wrote book reviews. He met Sara Farmer, the founder of Green Acre (which remains a Bahá’í School to this day and was visited by the Master). She asked him, \"Have you heard of the Persian Revelation?\". \"No,\" Stanwood replied. \"I know by your eyes you are ready for it, go and ask that lady to tell you about it.\" That lady happened to be Mary Lucas, a music teacher who had just returned from a visit to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá. They sat under an apple tree on the lawn at Green Acre, and in five minutes he was a Bahá’í.\nHe believes he accepted so immediately because he had already argued himself into the necessity of such a movement. This argument held true for Stanwood for all his 101 years. Since there is no clergy in the Bahá’í Faith, Stanwood gave up on his plans for the Unitarian ministry and decided to take up education as a career, having already done considerable teaching. Stanwood began his new teaching career at Robert College in Constantinople in 1907. This led to his first published book \"The Real Turk,\" which he wrote upon his return to America. It was the first book published in the United States which treated with complete sympathy the subjects of Islam and of the Turkish character.\nAt Robert College in 1908 Stanwood wrote ‘Abdu’l-Bahá for permission to visit Him. He was denied and went to Egypt for sight seeing. In the Shephard Hotel in Cairo, he bumped into his friend Lua Getsinger, who was going to see the Master. She had permission to take anyone she wished, so she took him along in February 1908. Stanwood described this momentous visit in his \"Memories of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá.\nThe closing words of his autobiography give an impression of his skill of pen and his sagacity of spirit, \"A Saga of Two Centuries\":\n\"A mere moral life is a series of suppressions. On the other hand, spiritual life is a series of expressions. Spiritual man has no need of repression. He tends to express radiant qualities in terms of loving service. His whole being takes on a new aspect of effulgence.\nLet us try to conceive what civilization will be like on this planet when these spiritual motivations function in full. Let us realize that man does not need to practice greed in order to prosper. Spiritual development and powers will bring guidance and abilities that will produce prosperity, both for the individual and for society, such as this planet has never hitherto known. Religious thought has looked forward to this Kingdom of God on earth as the culmination of life on this planet. Indeed it will be a time of great goodness which will issue forth in the flowing out of man's whole nature.\nLet us realize, then, that when we say \"the end of a World Age,\" we are not indicating catastrophe on the planet. On the contrary, we are looking forward to the dawn of a marvelous civilization, the details of which we cannot try to circumscribe at this point. Sufficient if we realize that the end of the past world age is a tremendously beneficent event, paving the way for a wonderful age of loving service, of creativeness, of glories of expression in all forms, and a sustained happiness such as man has never hitherto attained.\"\n",

              "Welcome to1553 4th Street, home of one of the most prominent Bahá’ís of African-Descent to declare his faith in Bahá’u’lláh. During the 1912 visit, as President (since 1909) of the Bethel Literary and Historical Association he was instrumental in arranging the April talk at the Metropolitan Church, where the Society met. Also, as a 1902 Howard University Law School graduate he also played a key role helping arrange the talk given at Howard University. Just a year prior to the Master's visit Mr. Louis George Gregory made pilgrimage to Haifa to visit the Master in the Holy Land. Thereafter, the Master arranged for the marriage of Mr. Gregory to a European-Descent woman, to help teach the world the level of Oneness to which He was guiding the world. His lifetime of service to the Faith earned him the title \"Hand of the Cause of God,\" within the Bahá’í Faith.\n\nLOUIS GREGORY Hand of the Cause of God\n\nHands of the Cause of God, manifest the fear of God in their conduct, manners, deeds and words. They are obliged to diffuse the Divine Fragrances, to edify souls, to promote learning, to improve character, and to be sanctified and detached themselves. They were first appointed by Bahá’u’lláh and later by Shoghi Effendi and charged with specific duties for protecting and propagating the Faith. Washington DC’s Louis Gregory was named a Hand of the Cause of God posthumously.\n\nLouis George Gregory was born on June 6, 1874, to the freed descendents of plantation owners and enslaved Africans. Louis grandmother was enslaved, and also an enslaved wife of plantation and slave owner George Washington Dargan of Darlington, South Carolina. Louise Gregory’s mother was their daughter. The Ku Klux Klan killed the man who the grandmother married after the civil war. Louis George Gregory took the name of his step father, who he looked up to and respected until his death in 1929 at the age of 87. His mother, grandmother and stepfather all worked hard to raise a literate, courteous and disciplined son. Furthermore, they raised him with religious beliefs that involved the putting of ideals into action.\n\nHe attended the first public school open to both African-Descent Americans and European-Descent Americans in Charleston, South Carolina. Louis went on to attend Avery Institute, a private secondary school in Charleston, and Fisk University in Nashville, Tennessee. Pressed by the racial issues of the time Gregory realized that a spiritual change had to happen before racial brotherhood could be embraced. It would not be enough simply to change laws. Peoples hearts had to change before unity could be achieved.\n\nHis step-father George Gregory, supported Louis in everything he did. He himself was a first sergeant in the Civil War serving in the 104th USCT (the same unit as Capt. Thorton Chase). George Gregory was the only known free African Descent American living in Charleston to join the Union Army of 3000 in the city. His bold and courageous stand for justice also led him to helping the interracial Carpenters Union. This union later astounded Mr. Louis George Gregory when he came in 1929 for his step-fathers funeral and found hundreds of European Americans present, as the labor union had put out a public ad in the newspaper asking all to attend. So well regarded was his step father.\n\nWhen Louis Gregory was 17, his mother died shortly after childbirth and his brother died as well.  Thus, at age 17 he was orphaned. Shortly thereafter George Gregory remarried into the prominent Charleston Noisette Family. Louis Noisette, another civil war veteran, had passed away while his child was in Lauretta Gregory's womb. Thus the only brother Harrison Noisette would ever know would be Louis Gregory. They became so close that in 1929 when his father died, Louis Gregory supported the entire inheritance going to Harrison who used it to open a successful barber shop on Lenox Avenue in Harlem which stayed open into the 21st Century. Also, two of Harrison's daughters would declare their Bahá’í Faith, one becoming a Secretary of the New York Spiritual Assembly. Upon Louis Gregory's passing, his wife Louise Gregory came to the Noisette home to seek comfort and support. They were family.\n\nTo have earned a bachelor's degree was in itself an outstanding accomplishment. In 1900, out of a population of about nine million African-Descent Americans in the United States, only about two thousand or 00.02% had graduated from a college or university. Only about 700 African-Descent American college students were enrolled that year. Like Louis Gregory, most attended one of the thirty-four Negro colleges. Relatively few were as fortunate as he in attending schools as good as Avery and Fisk.\n\nLouis Gregory’s highest aspirations had not yet been fulfilled, however. When he decided to become a lawyer, the outstanding law school open to substantial numbers of African-Descent Americans was at Howard University in Washington D.C. No European-Descent American schools in the South accepted African-Descent American graduate students, and very few African-Descent American colleges offered advanced degrees. A commitment to further study thus required not only exceptional ability and drive but willingness to spend years far from home, to venture from a familiar environment into the unknown.\n\nMr. Gregory received his LL.B. degree in March 1902. After being admitted to the bar, he and another young lawyer, James. A. Cobb, opened a law office in Washington, D.C. Their partnership ended in 1906, when Mr. Gregory took a position with the U.S. Treasury department.\n\nAt the Treasury Department Louis Gregorys ability to form close relationships led to an extraordinary friendship with a Southerner...a friendship which was to deliver the message to Louis G. Gregory which would forever change his life and the Faith in the world. His friend, Thomas H. Gibbs, was neither a Bahá’í, nor was he seriously interested in the Bahá’í\nFaith himself. What little he knew, however, he liked and wished to share with Louis.\n\nAs a favor to Mr. Gibbs, Louis went to attend a Bahá’í lecture on a stormy night in 1907. The speaker who was introduced as our teacher, was Lua Getsinger, who taught the first African-Descent American Bahá’í Robert Turner a decade earlier. At the meeting he met Pauline Hannen who invited him to another meeting, which he accepted.\n\nPauline Hannen, a European-Descent American Southerner, along with her husband, Joseph, were to become Mr. Gregory's friends and teachers. “The light they unfolded, he wrote of his period of study with the Hannens, “was so wonderful that for about a year we sat in dumb amazement, listening to their patient, loving talks, not knowing whether to advance or retreat, yet held by supernal power.”\n\nWhen the Hannens received permission in 1909 to join the rapidly growing stream of pilgrims visiting ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, recently freed after nearly a lifetime as a prisoner of the Ottoman government, Mr. Gregory retreated into other concerns, establishing his legal practice again on 1553 4th Street.\n[25A picture]  Yet, with the return of the Hannens, Louis’ interest grew. In July 23 1909 he sent Joseph and Pauline Hannen a note of gratitude for their role in leading him to the Faith, and considered himself a confirmed believer:\n\n“It comes to me that I have never taken occasion to thank you specifically for all your kindness and patience, which finally culminated in my acceptance of the great truths of the Bahá’í\nRevelation. It has given me an entirely new conception of Christianity and of all religion, and with it my whole nature seems changed for the better...It is a sane and practical religion, which meets all the varying needs of life, and I hope I shall ever regard it as a priceless possession.\n\nIn order to share this priceless possession with others,” he continued, he “hoped to arrange a large scale Bahá’í meeting, which as many as fifteen hundred people might be expected to attend.” It would be held in the fall of 1909 under the auspices of the Bethel Literary and Historical Association, a Negro organization of which he was president.\n\nAnother of Mr. Gregory’s first actions as a Bahá’í was to write to ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, as was the practice at that time. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s reply, received in November 1909, expressed not only hopes for spiritual development, which were customary in all of His letters, but extraordinary expectations regarding Louis Gregory’s singular role in race relations to \"the means whereby the white and colored people shall close their eyes to racial differences\" and \"the cause of the guidance of both races.\"\n\n\nFor Louis Gregory any hope of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s was to be regarded as an injunction. In 1909, at the age of thirty-five, he turned his back on a secure economic position as a lawyer within the small elite of African-Descent American professionals, directing increasing degrees of attention to a new unpaid calling. For the rest of his long life he put his Bahá’í activities foremost, finally abandoning his profession altogether to become a racial amity worker, as he often referred to himself, surviving on a bare subsistence, devoting himself to the self-imposed demands of his work: constant travel, writing, and lecturing in the cause of racial unity.\n\nThe most prominent African-Descent American leader to become a declared believer through the untiring work of Louis Gregory was Professor Alain Locke of Howard University, who participated as an active Bahá’í in many teaching and racial amity activities in the 1920s and 1930s, and served as editor for Robert S. Abbot, the founder of the Chicago Defender. He formally accepted the Faith in 1934.\n\nEven as the period of 1906-1909 saw the formation of the NAACP from the Niagara Movement, and the National Urban League, Louis Gregory found the Bahá’í Cause. It was not national but international, not biracial but multiracial, not issue oriented but issue encompassing, not directed toward social change in itself, but toward spiritual transformation of both the individual and society. It promised to alter completely the patterns of racial discrimination reinforced by class, caste, and religion in America and throughout the world, ultimately to create a new world civilization in which the characteristics and contributions of all people would play a part.\n\nSome European-Descent American Bahá’ís were not racially mixing in 1909, either because it was not customary, or because it was distasteful to them personally. Many who had been attracted to the Faith by one principle or another, or by the Person of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, were unaware that to be a Bahá’í meant to be a proponent of racial equality. There did not yet exist any administrative means or even any general sense of necessity to bring such unreconstructed European-Descent Americans into conformity with the Bahá’í principle of oneness.\n\nLouis Gregory proved to be an agent of change in the Washington community. Under his questioning, the old, unconsidered habits of segregating had to be confronted by the community,and once the issue had been raised, it could not be dismissed.\n\nFrom March 6th with the first formal interracial meeting through December 12th of that year, Mr. Louis Gregory frequently spoke and succeeded in helping to take the first historic steps toward desegregating this Southern community. In his own words the Bahá’í laws of Oneness were for this day and must be applied.\n\nRight away in 1910 Louis Gregory made his first teaching trip, stopping in eight Southern cities, including Richmond, Virginia; Durham, North Carolina; Charleston, South Carolina; and Macon, Georgia. He recalled that in every city people were found who accepted the great Message, however crudely and abruptly given. The spirit was powerful, but communities were not established at the time, because the system of follow-up work was not then developed.\n\nHis second area of endeavor was Bahá’í administration. Well suited by his education and legal training to become a leader in the Bahá’í community, he was the first African-Descent American elected to a Washington D.C. Bahá’í office in February 1911. Less than two years after he became a Bahá’í, when a special election was called to fill a vacancy on Washington’s Working Committee. He wrote to Joseph Hannen:\n\nI have your kind favor of the 4th, advising me of the action of the Working Committee of the Bahá’í Assembly in electing me to membership. My emotion upon reading it was a commingling of pleasure and embarrassment. There is joy, because I know that this action springs from a noble impulse on the part of the committee. It evinces breadth and the Guidance of the Spirit. Who knows how far-reaching the effect will be in advancing the Cause of God in the future? The embarrassment is due to the fact that what is truly a great honor should be given one so unworthy. I agree to serve temporarily, until someone with a wise head and noble heart may be found, who may thus more fitly represent my race.\n\nHis third area of endeavor was to seek a pilgrimage early in 1910 to the Holy Land, as his teachers the Hannens had done. He was denied permission. “It is at present not in accord with wisdom,” ‘Abdu’l-Bahá explained. “Postpone this matter to another and more opportune time.”\n\nA few months later, exercising His new freedom in the Holy Land, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá left the Holy Land for the first time in more than forty years to travel to Egypt. It was from Ramleh, near Alexandria, late in 1910, that he sent Louis Gregory an invitation to come in the Spring. Mr. Gregory reserved passage on a ship sailing from New York on 25 March 1911. He was able to plan an extended trip that included stops in Europe as well as in Egypt and Palestine.\n\nMany fellow Bahá’ís in Washington, well aware that Louis Gregory was the first African-Descent American American to have the privilege and opportunity of pilgrimage at the express invitation of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá, shared his excitement. On 22 March, Mr. And Mrs. Andrew J. Dyers regular Wednesday Bahá’ís meeting became a surprise farewell party, attended by more than fifty Bahá’ís and guests. Even though the Wednesday meetings were primarily for African-Descent Americans, on this occasion a number of European-Descent American Bahá’ís participated. Joseph Hannen wrote of the evening in the Star of the West:\n\nMr. Gregory was given the seat of honor, at the head of the long table, and his chair was surmounted by a horse-shoe of flowers. While refreshments were being served, speeches were made by a number of people, including Dr. W.B.Evans, Principal of the Armstrong Manual Training School; Judge Gibbs, former U.S. Consul to Madagascar; Professor W. H. H. Hart, of Howard University; Professor G.W. Cook, Of Harvard University; Mr. Edward J. Braithwaite; Mr. Duffield; Miss Murrell, of the faculty of Armstrong Manual Training School; Miss Grace Robarts; Mrs. Claudia S. Coles; Mr. Charles Mason Remey; Professor Stanwood Cobb; Mr. And Mrs. Hannen. Mr. Gregory responded in a feeling manner to the good wishes expressed.\n\nGregory describes ‘Abdu’l-Bahá when he met him on Pilgrimage in the following way:\n\nPresidents and senators, cabinet members and ambassadors, justices and kings of commerce and trade, inventors, discoverers, monarchs of other lands, all either singly or together, seem to pale into insignificance when compared with this wonderful man who had spent about forty years in prison, wrote Louis Gregory. Mr. Gregory remembered in detail his first impressions of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá:\n\nWhen...I saw him for the first time he was about sixty-seven years of age, about medium height, with a strong frame and symmetrical features. His face was deeply furrowed and his complexion about the shade of parchment. His carriage was erect and his form strikingly majestic and beautiful. His hands and nails were shapely and pure. His silver hair touched his shoulders. His beard was snow white, with eyes light blue and penetrating, his nose somewhat aquiline. His voice was powerful, but capable of infinite pathos, tenderness and sympathy. His dress was that of the Oriental gentleman of rank, simple and neat, yet very graceful. The color of his apparel was light, the outer robe being made of alpaca. On his head rested a light fez surrounded by a white turban. The meekness of the servant, the majesty of the king, were in that brow and form.\n\n‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself observed that Louis Gregory had been transformed, had become quite another Gregory. In Palestine, the pilgrims visited the shrines of Bahá’u’lláh\n and of the Báb, His forerunner. They came to know the places where Bahá’u’lláh\nhad lived from His banishment to the penal colony of ‘Akká in 1868, until His Ascension in 1892. In both Egypt and Palestine Mr. Gregory met members and close associates of Bahá’u’lláh’s family; he was especially impressed with ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s grandson, Shoghi Effendi, who in 1921 was to become the Guardian of the Bahá’í Faith. The other pilgrims also contributed much to Mr. Gregory’s experience. An English-woman named Louisa Mathew, who was present during his first meeting with the Master, won admiration for her long range of accomplishments and great devotion to the Faith.\n\nDuring their interviews, the Master dispelled any uncertainty that may have lingered in Mr. Gregory’s mind concerning the urgent need for racial unity in America and his particular role in its advancement. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá Himself raised the subject of race during their first meeting, when He asked in general terms, What of the conflict between the white and colored races? Louis Gregory recalled:\n\nthis question made me smile, for I at once felt that my Inquirer, although He had never in person visited America, yet knew more of conditions than I could ever know. I answered that there was much friction between the races. That those who accepted the Bahá’í teaching had hopes of an amicable settlement of racial differences, while others were despondent.\n\nAfter the party of pilgrims returned to Egypt from Haifa and ‘Akká, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  stressed once again the importance of racial unity. In the presence of a roomful of followers, He addressed to one of the outstanding European-Descent American Bahá’ís in Washington a letter (what Bahá’ís term a Tablet), regarding racial segregation:\n\nYou have written that there were several meetings of joy and happiness, one for white ... another for colored people. Praise be to God! As both races are under the protection of the All-Knowing God, therefore the lamps of unity must be lighted in such a manner in these meetings that no distinction be perceived between the white and colored. Colors are phenomenal; but the realities of men are Essence. When there exists unity of the Essence what power has the phenomenal? When the Light of Reality is shining what power has the darkness of the unreal? If it be possible, gather together these two races, black and white, into one assembly and put such love into their hearts that they shall not only unite but even intermarry. Be sure that the result of this will abolish differences and disputes between black and white. Moreover, by the will of God, may it be so. This is a great service to the world of humanity.\n\nAfter dictating this Tablet, Mr. Gregory recalled, he took a vessel containing blackberries and gave some of these to each of the friends present.\n\nUndoubtedly, Louis Gregory recognized that ‘Abdu’l-Bahá dictated His statement not only to the Bahá’ís in Washington, but also to those followers who were in His presence that day. Among the latter He then chose to reinforce His words about race by the symbolic sharing of the delicious, black-colored fruit. But, as Louis Gregory, and his fellow pilgrim Louisa Matthew later realized, the Masters motives were more complicated still. He never explained why He had delayed Mr. Gregory’s pilgrimage; but it soon became clear that, whether ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had deliberately brought Louis and Louisa together, He had henceforth envisioned for them a great service to the world of humanity. As a result of His loving encouragement, they soon were to marry, thus becoming the first of many Bahá’í interracial couples to demonstrate the principle of racial unity on the most fundamental level.\n\nIndeed, on the 27th of September, 1911 Louis Gregory married Louisa. In 1912, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  revealed a Tablet to this recently married couple:\n\nO thou revered wife of his honor, Gregory! Do thou consider what a bounty God hath-\nbestowed upon thee in giving thee a husband as Mr. Gregory who is the essence of the love of God and is a symbol of guidance!\n\nWhen Louis Gregory left Alexandria, however, he had as yet no inkling of the marriage that lay ahead. ‘Abdu’l-Bahá had simply restated the personal goal work for unity and harmony between the races that He had given Mr. Gregory in the first months of his Bahá’í life. During their final visit in Ramleh the Master had suggested the means to achieve this goal. “Go forth and speak of the Cause of God,” He had urged. “Visit the friends. Gladden their hearts. You will be the means of Guidance to many souls.” And as Mr. Gregory was leaving, one of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s secretaries had brought a parting message of encouragement: “This morning ‘Abdu’l-Bahá spoke of you and told me to say to you: Keep your face turned to the Kingdom and fear nothing!” For the moment no greater task seemed possible than the task Louis Gregory had already been given, nor could he have received more soul-stirring encouragement.\n\nLouis traveled to Germany at the request of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá after his pilgrimage, on his way back to the United States. In Germany he spoke at a number of gatherings to Bahá’ís and their friends. In a letter to one of the German Bahá’ís, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’  Himself called attention to Louis Gregory's color: \"When he arrived at Stuttgart, although being of black color, yet he shone as a bright light in the meeting of the friends.\" Thus ‘Abdu’l-Bahá shared Louis Gregory, making him a symbol of racial equality. The German Bahá’ís without mentioning color, echoed ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s description of Mr. Gregory in the following report of his visit: \"In May 1911, we had the privilege of entertaining Mr. Louis G. Gregory, of Washington , D.C., who came to us from the presence of ‘Abdu’l-Bahá,, throbbing with new life and light. A reception in his honor was held at 24 Canzelei Str. To the home of the Stabler family in Stuttgart; to the ... Kaslin [family] in Esslingen, and to the ... Schweizer [family] in Zuffenhausen, near Stuttgart, our honored guest came and told the assembled friends much that was interesting..\"\n\nIn letters both to Germany and to America ‘Abdu’l-Bahá made absolutely clear the high regard in which He held Louis Gregory and the extent to which the pilgrimage had matured and strengthened him. When one of the Bahá’ís in Stuttgart wrote Him of Mr. Gregory's visit, ‘Abdu’l-Bahá replied: \"Verily, he has advanced in this journey. He received another life, and obtained another power. When he returned, Gregory was, quite another Gregory. He had become a new creation...This man shall progress.\"\n\nTo one of the Washington Bahá’ís the Master wrote:\n\n\"Mr. Gregory arrived with the utmost love and spirituality and returned with infinite happiness. He added to his faith and assurance and found firmness and steadfastness. Undoubtedly you shall see these things at the time of his arrival. It is my hope that he may become the cause of increasing the love of the friends.\"\n\nIn still another tablet ‘Abdu’l-Bahá suggested the kind of welcome the returning pilgrim should receive in his homeland: Mr. Gregory is at present in great happiness...He will return to America very soon, and you, the white people, should then honor and welcome this shining colored man in such a way that all the people will be astonished.\n\nWhile Louis’ return went unheralded, as more attention was paid to the coming of the first female student from Persia to study in the United States was arriving on the same boat. Undeterred, Louis kept working diligently in the Cause and was the first to travel teach throughout the South. And his station was begun to be recognized with his election to the 1911 Washington DC Working Committee - the first African-Descent American elected to serve on a Bahá’í consultative body in America and perhaps the world.\n\nLater, in Washington, D.C. he organized a speaking engagement at Howard University and the Metropolitan A.M.E. Church for ‘Abdu’l-Bahá’s 1912 visit. With Louis Gregory at his side, in Howard University, the leader of the Bahá’í Faith, recently released from imprisonment, spoke of the issue of racial unity. On April 23rd at noon, the speech was given to students of Howard University. After the speech, the head of the Bahá’í faith, was invited to lunch at the charge d'affaires of the Persian Legation. He insisted that Louis Gregory be invited and gave Mr. Gregory the seat of honor at his right hand side, in the presence of such luminaries as Admiral Peary, Alexander Graham Bell, and the Turkish Ambassador. With one act, the head of the Bahá’í Faith, had swept aside both segregation by race and categorization by social rank. The other talk at the [Picture 24A.] A.M.E. Church was in the context of the Bethel Literary Society, of which Louis Gregory was the president. \n\nNow on a national stage, Louis Gregory attended the convention for erecting the\nhouse of worship in Chicago, as the delegate from Washington in 1912. On\nthe 27th of April 1912 he spoke at the \"Festival of Ridvan\". Then on April 30th 1912,\nhe became the only African-Descent American elected to the first national administrative body\nof the Bahá’í Faith in America. Later, the same day ‘Abdu’l-Bahá arrived and spoke in Chicago and laid the cornerstone for the Mother Temple of the West.\n\nSoon after ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  left Washington D.C., the following Summer, Louis Gregory continued to teach and caused ‘Abdu’l-Bahá  to remark about \n\"...a meeting of the colored people in Harpers Ferry which was brought about through Mr. Gregory. Truly I say he is confirmed, for he believes in His Holiness Bahá’u’lláh with his heart and soul. I pray in his behalf that he may become the means of the illumination of the Negro world in America and that the two races may associate with each other in amity and that all of them like unto a flock of doves, white and black may soar toward the supreme apex.\"\n\nTeaching was not Mr. Gregory's only mode of service to the Bahá’í Cause. He was active in other Bahá’í affairs and served on various national Bahá’í committees. He was the only African-Descent American to be elected to the Bahá’í Temple Unity committee, the International organization that oversaw construction of the first Bahá’í House of Worship in the Western Hemisphere. He was also the first African-Descent American to be elected to the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá’í of the United States and Canada. He was elected to the governing body of the Bahá’í Faith in America a number of times (1922, 1924, 1927, 1932,1934 and 1946).\n\nIn 1937, in response to the leader of the Bahá’ís loving guidance, he advanced the Faith in Haiti. As an African-Descent American taking the Bahá’í teachings to Europe, Africa and other continents, he helped make America a source of spiritual enlightenment, and helped ensure that all the world will receive this heavenly blessing. More importantly, through this world embracing vision of the Bahá’í Faith, African-Descent American Bahá’í found an answer to the nagging riddle of the brutal displacement of their slave forebearers from the far off continent of their origin.. Louis Gregory, recognized that the redemptive power of resolving racial discord at home would generate a force to move the world.\n\nThe eloquent testimony paid by ‘Abdu’l-Bahá and his grandson to Louis G. Gregory speaks to his station as a mighty soul enlightening humanity :\n\nAt a time when misunderstanding among races was excessive, ye were engaged in bringing about full understanding. Ye have striven for the enlightenment of hearts by the light of Love and for the bestowal of sight and hearing upon the negligent; that the slumberer may awake and the ignorant be made heedful and aware.\n\nThat pure soul has a heart like unto transparent water. He is like unto pure gold. This is why he is acceptable in any market and is current in every country.\n\nYour splendid activities, your single mindedness and devotion to the great work you are doing for the Cause is an inspiration to me in my task and a refreshment in the midst of my arduous duties. ... Well done, my good and faithful friend!... I read the account of your travels with heartfelt joy and gratitude and I will continue to pray for you that you may be enabled to achieve still greater things for so glorious and mighty a Cause.\n\nI have nothing but admiration and gratitude for the heroic constancy, mature wisdom, tireless energy, and shining love with which you are conducting your eve expanding work of service to the Cause of Bahá’u’lláh. You hardly realize what a help you are to me in my arduous work. Your grateful brother...\n\nThe spirit which you have demonstrated...is indeed worthy of the praise and admiration of the Supreme Concourse. The place you occupy in my heart, and the measure of admiration I cherish for the sublimity of your faith, I cannot describe. That you will visit Persia, as the worthy and first representative of your noble race in that historic land; that you will in the days to come supplement your great and memorable work in the states with further services in Europe, I feel assured and confident. ... With a heart filled with love and gratitude\n\nWe conclude this vignette on Louis Gregory in his own words. The following words he wrote in the last chapter of his manuscript Racial Unity written in the last years of his life:\n\nThe interests of no groups or classes will be overlooked or forgotten. The wish of the underprivileged to be treated as fairly as are other Americans in every avenue of human advancement is both proper and reasonable. Untenable is the attitude of those who would withhold it because of complexion or other superficial reasons. The friends of the oppressed show rapid increase in numbers and powers. Assuming that the victims of injustice will continue their struggle, no human might can long debar them from their long sought goal. Earth and air, fire and water, the stars in their courses, the high tide of destiny, and the Will of divine Providence are all arrayed against the forces of oppression.\n\nOn his passing on July 30, 1951 he had reached the age of seventy seven. The American Bahá’í community was comforted by the following cable from the head of the Bahá’í Faith:\n\nProfoundly grievous loss of dearly beloved, nobleminded, golden hearted Louis Gregory, pride and example to the Negro adherents of the Faith ... Rising Bahá’í generation in African continent will glory in his memory and emulate his example.\n\nHis earthly remains lie entombed at Green Acre. The summer of Mr. Gregory’s return from Pilgrimage in 1911, took him for the first time to Green Acre, a progressive conference center that had been established in 1894 by Sarah Farmer in Eliot, Maine, with the help of Phoebe Hearst and had attracted such notable figures as Swami Vivekananda and Booker T. Washington. Louis Gregory's visit provided to be the beginning of a long and fruitful association with Green Acre.\n",

              "Welcome to the Washington Conservatory of Music, at 902 T Street, where the first Baha'i Center located at the heart of an African Descent neighborhood was made use of. It held the first integrated Baha'i feasts outside of a private home. It was the Washington Conservatory of Music and School of Expression, founded in 1903 by concert pianist, entrepreneur and educator Harriet Gibbs Marshall (1868-1941), was one of the citys earliest institutions promoting the arts for children and adults. Marshall worked to inspire and train African-Descent American musicians and to encourage them to create and embrace their own heritage of concert music. She also pioneered the hiring of married women, and herself ran one of the longest running female run businesses in the city. Instructors included Marshall, her future husband Napoleon B. Marshall and great Georgia Fraser Goins, and Margaret Just (Howard University professor Ernest Everett Justs daughter). In 1904 Marshalls father Judge M.W. Gibbs donated the majestic corner house at 902 T Street for the schools use, to cheer her daughter on the death of her mother. Judge Gibbs was a great abolitionist. The school attracted students and faculty from around the United States and produced leaders in many disciplines. Many Baha'is, were employed by the Conservatory and others donated their time such as Hand of the Cause of God Mr. Louis George Gregory who was its treasurer for a time.\n\nThe national newletter of the American Baha'i Community reported upon the building in the following manner: \"Two important special meetings held since our last report were the Unity Feast of Sunday, Oct. 16th (1910), at a Memorial Service, commemorative of Mrs. Amalie Knobloch, on Tuesday evening, Oct. 26th. The Unity Feast was given at the Conservatory of Music, and our colored friends joined with us, the hosts being Mr. and Mrs. George S. Hopper, Miss Hopper, Miss Little and Mr. Louis G. Gregory. The attendance was over one hundred and some of the most influential representatives of the colored people were present. Tasteful decorations, beautiful music and eloquent speeches adorned this spiritual meeting. The memorial service was held in the McNeal studio, which was decorated with a profusion of cosmos and chrysanthemums. Tablets or prayers were read for the friends who had left our circle during the year, among those thus remembered being Mrs. L. A. Hester, Mrs. Mayo, little Louise Hopkins, Miss Charlotte Colt and the mother and father of Mrs. Fred J. Woodward. The spirit of this meeting was very powerful and all present felt the peace which passeth understanding.\"\n\nMrs. Harriet Gibbs Marshall of Washington, D.C. was born in 1869, kindly donated the Conservatory of Music at 902 T Street NW, for use by the Baha'i community for teaching and administration. She was the first Baha'i to pioneer to Haiti. She set up the first Music School to teach African-Descent music in that country. She was able to do so due to her husband Napoleon B. Marshall's USA military tenure there. Later, she coached Hand of the Cause of God Louis and Louisa on their teaching in Haiti. Mr. Marshall was noted by Mr. Gregory to be a great friend of the Faith.\n\nThe Gregories reported back to her from Haiti: You (Harriet) are very much loved among them (the Haitians) for the constructive services you have rendered them. Welcome to Haiti, said one of the officials upon knowing that I had a letter of introduction from you. The Bahai seed sown by you is also having effect. So you should be both happy and thankful to the Lord of Might, Bahaullah, that you have served the establishment of His Kingdom on earth. Following your advice, we had service at the Bellevue Hotel for a week and had contacts with many prominent people ... Mrs. Gregory joins me in Baha'i greetings, best wishes and thanks. ...\nP.S. you will do well as far as you are able, to keep in touch with the Bahais. Even if you cannot attend meetings, ask them to send you the publication Bahai News, so you will be informed about current-happenings in the faith and spiritually what comes from its Guardian, Shoghi Effendi, in the Holy Land. L.G.G.\n\nIn 1930 she wrote a book, \"The Story of Haiti: From the Discovery of the Island by Christopher Columbus to the Present Day.\" The book stood out for being a first hand account, in contrast to its peers at the time. In 1937 she founded the National Negro Music Centre and participated in the founding of the National Association of Negro Musicians. She passed on in 1941.\n\nThe building truly stands in the heart of one of the most prominent African-Descent American communities in America. The African American Civil War Monument stands one block to the west, then turning north east on Vermont Avenue then walk 1\/2 a block up to the monument. Look on the monument for the 104th United States Colored Troop Regiment and you will find both the names of the Step Father of Mr. Louis George Gregory - First Sgt. George Gregory as well as his Captain Mr. Thorton Chase, the first American to declare his faith in Baha'u'llah in 1894, listed as (W.B. Chase).\n\nOne of the Baha'is who taught at the school was Mrs. Coralie Franklin Cook, the first director of its school of eloquence:\n\nMrs. Coralie Franklin Cook, \"Firm and Steadfast\"\n\nOne of the most prominent ladies of the national capital she was a Baha'i who remained firm and steadfast during all her years. She became attracted to the Faith, through the Wednesday meetings held at the Dyer home. She later served on the Baha'i Race Amity Committee in 1921.\n\nMrs. Cook was a member of the Washington DC Board of Education. The high social station she occupied, is also indicated by her chairing part of the Fourth Pan African Congress. The Congress was held in August 1927 in New York City. It was the largest Pan African Congress ever held, with 208 delegates and 5000 visitors. DuBois entrusted the helm of this congress, his last, to women. The New York Amsterdam News gives this account of her leadership on August 23, 1927:\n\nFor the afternoon the Congress considered African Missions, with Coralie Franklin Cook in the chair. Helen Curtis gave the principal address, in which the missionary opportunities were stressed. She believes that the responsibility of Africa's redemption rests with the Negro race of America. She pleaded hard economic opportunities and climatic conditions as arresting agents of the native's progress. She thought that the churches carrying on missionary labors ought to be diligent in sending supplies and money promptly and ought to pay the workers living wage\n\nMrs. Coralie Franlin Cook, gave a hint of her own personal interests by the address which she gave at the Pan African Congress. Her address was on Negro Poets. She made a sympathetic presentation of the works of Phyllis Wheatley, the slave girl of the eighteenth century who wrote many poems, Paul Lawrence Dunbar, William Stanley Braithwatie, Jessie Faucet and others.\n\n\n\n\nHarriet Gibbs Marshall\n\nA Document-ary Journey into the Washington (D.C.) Conservatory of Music, 1903-1960\nby Joellen ElBashir\n\"Art is the imperishable legacy of a people; its influence, caught up and transmitted to other generations and different lands, is like an unending vibration,\" wrote Natalie Curtis Burlin, noted early 20th-century ethnomusicologist. That African Americans possessed such a legacy was firmly believed by Harriet Gibbs Marshall [1869-1941], concert pianist, music educator, author, and founder, in 1903, of the Washington Conservatory of Music, a school for the \"special musical development of the colored American.\" Her dream was to open a music conservatory for African Americans that would inspire and train Black musicians and encourage them to create and embrace their own heritage of concert music. She also wished to uplift the community by preserving the rich African American musical heritage and by increasing the exposure of Black audiences to professional musical performances and other cultural events.\nUnder her management, and in later years, under that of her cousin, Victoria Muse, the Conservatory represented the nations most successful Black-owned and -operated music school to have advocated the study and performance of Black music. Throughout its 57-year existence, the schools highly trained faculty brought in talented students from all over the United States and produced leaders in the field from among its graduates.\nThroughout its existence, and especially in the early years, the Conservatory faculty encouraged the desire for music in the Washington, D.C., community by sponsoring annual concerts featuring nationally famous Black musicians, recitals and other cultural events.\nThe establishment of the Conservatory was only part of Harriet Gibbs Marshalls dream. She envisioned a National Negro Music Center, at which the Conservatory would be the facility used for teaching. The aim of the Center, which opened in 1936, was to foster research and preservation of the rich musical heritage of Black Americans. The actual scope of the Center fell short of her dreams, primarily because of insufficient funding. It did, however, become a repository for published works by African American composers. Thousands of pieces of sheet music of Black composers were collected and preserved under Marshalls direction, thus fulfilling part of her dream of creating a historical reserve for Black music research.\nHarriet Gibbs Marshall was born in 1868 in Victoria, British Columbia, to Mifflin Wistar Gibbs and Maria Ann (Alexander) Gibbs. Her father, a native of Philadelphia, was a prominent businessman, who moved his family to Oberlin, Ohio, a year after her birth. In 1889, she became the first African American to graduate from the Oberlin Conservatory of Music. Two years later, she founded a music school at Eckstein-Norton University, an industrial school in Kentucky. Her objective was to preserve the rich heritage of African American music by developing the musical talent of Black students.\nIn 1900, she became director of music for the Black public schools of Washington, D.C. It was while she held this position that she opened the Washington Conservatory of Music in the True Reformers Hall (12th and W Streets, NW). The following year, Mrs. Marshalls father gave her the building at 902 T Street, NW, which became the permanent home of the school. Embarking on a letter-writing campaign in which she sought financial support for her school from businessmen, congressmen, ambassadors, and others, she received encouragement from such notables as W.E.B. Du Bois; composers W.C. Handy, William Grant Still, and Nathaniel Dett; and Eleanor Roosevelt, who agreed to sit on the board of the Conservatory.\nWhen, in 1904, E. Azalia Hackley, concert soprano and pioneer music educator, accepted a position at the Conservatory, she wrote to Marshall: \"In a faint, far-off way, I have been interested for some time in the kind of thing which you wish to do. But there is no such talent in other places as you have in Washington, D.C. So I willingly accept your proposal.\" Hackley was joined by Clarence Cameron White, noted concert pianist, and J. Hilary Taylor, publisher of the Negro Music Journal. Will Marion Cook, well-known composer, soon joined the faculty as director of the Conservatorys choral group, known as the Folk Singers. Three years after the school was established, records show there were 160 students enrolled and nine instructors on the faculty, including Shirley Graham, who would marry W.E.B. Du Bois in later years. At the height of its success, in the late 1940s and into the 1950s, the Conservatory employed 14 faculty members and enrolled as many as 175 students.\n\nAfter Mrs. Marshalls death in 1941, the Conservatory slowly began to lose much of the prestige it had enjoyed under her leadership. By the mid-1950s, the number and variety of activities had decreased. The Conservatory eventually closed in 1960, leaving a legacy of Black music scholarship and training.\n*****************************************************************************\nTo learn more about the life of Harriet Gibbs Marshall and the history and achievements of the Conservatory see Doris E.

Her father, Mifflin Gibbs, was a prominent businessman and political\nfigure who was elected a municipal judge in 1873 in Little Rock, Arkansas. In 1879\nPresident McKinley appointed Gibbs as the United States Consul to Tamatave,\nMadagascar. Maria Alexander, Harriets mother, was born in Kentucky and was a\ngraduate of Oberlin College. When Harriet was nine years old, she started taking piano\nlessons with her sister, Ida. She began studying at the Oberlin Conservatory of Music at\nage 11 and at age 15 she graduated from high school and began her collegiate studies at\nOberlin (McGinty, 1979, p. 60).\nTeaching Career and Washington Conservatory of Music\nIn 1889 Harriet became the first African-American woman to graduate from the\nOberlin Conservatory of Music with a Bachelor of Music degree in piano performance.\nShe later continued her studies in Boston, Chicago, and then Paris where she studied with\nMoritz Moszowski. After touring the United States briefly as a concert pianist she\nacquired a teaching position at the Normal School in Huntsville, Alabama. Her next\nposition was at Eckstein-Norton University, a small black industrial college in Cane\nSpring, Kentucky. Harriet established the music department during her ten-year stay at\nthis institution. She raised money for the construction of a music building by performing\nsolo piano concerts that also included the Eckstein-Norton Choir, a group she organized\nand directed. In 1900, she left Cane Spring and moved to Washington, D.C. to become\nthe Assistant Director of Music for African-American public schools. However, Harriet\nwas frustrated in this position because of the lack of funding and insufficient facilities in\nthe schools, which undermined her efforts to meet the needs of her black students. Even\n\nthough she was in charge of the black music department, most of the authority lied in the\nhands of her administrators. Harriet had intended to establish a music conservatory for\nblack students for some time and being the Assistant Director of Music for African-\nAmerican public schools made her realize even more how much an African-American\nconservatory was needed. She convened a group of music teachers who were well\nrecognized for their contributions to music education in order to organize a board of\ndirectors for her proposed school. This group included two Washington city\ncommissioners, the director of the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and various other\nprofessional men and women of Washington, D.C. (McGinty, 1979, p. 63).\nThe result of this groups planning was the establishment of the Washington\nConservatory of Music in 1903. The faculty included world-renowned African-American\nmusicians such as Clarence Cameron White, violinist and composer; J. Hilary Taylor,\npianist and founder of the Negro Music Journal; and Emma Azalia Smith Hackley,\nsoprano and educator (discussed at length earlier in this thesis), along with Gabriele\nLewis Pelham, Livonia Haywood Johnson, Jeanette Williamson, and Harriet herself. The\nConservatory offered courses in applied instruction (piano, voice, organ, strings), string\nensemble, music history and musical biography, harmony (including counterpoint),\npublic school music, and class piano (Schmalenberger, 2004, p. 45).\nThe opening of the conservatory was announced in the Negro Music Journal,\nwhich served as the official publication of the school. J. Hilary Taylor explained in it the\npositive impact that this school would have on the black community: This movement\nshould meet with the approval and support of all earnest music-lovers and educators and\nthe public in general. If we desire racial progress, we must encourage all worthy\nmovements that tend to uplift a community (Negro Music Journal, 1902, p.28). Also\n\nfeatured in this article was a list of the board members, a faculty roster, and pictures of\nsome of the faculty.\nThe Washington Conservatory of Music was first housed in the True Reformers\nHall. In 1904 Harriets father, Mifflin Gibbs, gave her a building at 902 Tea Street, N.\nW., which became the schools permanent home. When the school moved from the True\nReformers Hall, a new department, the School of Expression, which offered training in\nelocutionary and rhetorical skills, was added. Coralie Franklin Cook became the first\ndirector. Cook had studied rhetoric and public speaking at several colleges including\nEmerson College of Oratory in Boston. She eventually became the Chair of the\nDepartment of Oratory at Howard University (Schmalenberger, 2004, p. 49).\nThe conservatory struggled to remain open because of financial difficulties during\nits first several years. However, Harriet devised several ways to raise money to keep the\nschool open. For example, she invited noted public figures to speak at student concerts,\nincluding Mary Church Terrell, an activist and teacher who started the National\nAssociation of Colored Women (NACW) (Schmalenberger, 2004, p. 59). Fortunately, the\nconservatory also received financial contributions from philanthropist E. V. Macy and E.\nH. Dodge, along with Alain Locke, W.E.B. DuBois, Carter G.Woodson, The National\nAssociation for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), Samuel Coleridge-\nTaylor, the Oberlin Conservatory of Music, and Silver Burdett, a music textbook\npublishing company. These contributions were the result of Harriets many\ncorrespondences with state representatives, politicians, musicians, and any other potential\ndonors (McGinty, 1979, p. 63).\nOn June 3, 1906 Harriet married Napoleon B. Marshall who joined the faculty as\na music history teacher and also took over many of the business arrangements (McGinty,\n1979, p. 64). By this time, the conservatory had nine faculty members and 160 students.\n\nIt was becoming widely known and attracted students from the North, South, and\nMidwest.\nThe first commencement ceremony of the Washington Conservatory of Music\nwas held in 1910 at the Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church. The graduates\nwere from five departments: School of Expression (Harriet Collier, Nathaniel Guy),\nTeachers Course in Piano and Theory (Celestine Lott, Florence Camper, Deserie Catlet,\nCornelia Barton, Cleveland Lemons), Piano Tuning (Daisy Westbrook), Piano, Theory\nand Voice (Daisy Westbrook), and the Artist Course in Piano and Theory (Ruth\nGrimshaw, Helen Moss, Henry Lee Grant) (McGinty, p. 64). Grant would go on to\nbecome one of the founders of the National Association of Negro Musicians and Duke\nEllingtons harmony teacher. The following is an excerpt from Ellingtons autobiography\nMusic is My Mistress (1976):\nHenry Grant, who taught music in our high school heard about me and invited me\nto come to his house to study harmony. It ended up a hidden course in harmony\nthat lighted the direction to a more highly developed composition. It was a music\nfoundation and I jumped at the opportunity because most of the advanced\nmusicians had taken harmony from Henry Grant (Ellington, 1976, p. 28).\nThe conservatorys second commencement, in 1911, was an even larger\ncelebration than the first. This time it was held at the Howard Theater, one of the nations\nfirst African-American theaters, which helped to launch the careers of many talented\nartists such as Duke Ellington, Billie Holiday, and Ethel Waters. Members of the\nPhiladelphia Philharmonic (now named the Philadelphia Orchestra) came to participate in\nthe orchestra at the commencement ceremony. Bessie Wilhelmina Patterson, one of the\nfive graduates, played the Rubenstein piano concerto, opus 70. Patterson went on to\n\nbecome director of music at Prairie View Normal School in Texas (McGinty, 1979,\np.65).\nNational Negro Music Center\nHarriet began a new project in 1920. She wanted to build a center that would be\ndevoted to the preservation of black music and set a goal to raise $100,000\n(approximately $1.2 million today) to go toward what would be called the National\nNegro Music Center. The primary fundraiser for this project was a program called Three\nPeriods of Negro Music and Drama, a large-scale event that included music oratory,\npageantry, and dance (Schmalenberger, 2004, p. 160). The program was divided into\nthree sections: African, Antebellum in America, and Modern. The African section\nfeatured performers dressed in African garb who presented songs, dances, and recited\nfolktales from African culture. The second section, Antebellum in America, included\nthree Negro folksongs and three songs from an operetta written by T.A. Heathman and A.\nRussell Woodlay. The last section, Modern, was more lengthy than the first two sections.\nTwelve songs, ten of which were written by African-American composers such as H. T.\nBurleigh, Samuel Coleridge-Taylor and R. Nathaniel Dett, were presented\n(Schmalenberger, 2004, p. 162). There were two performances of Three Periods of\nNegro Music and Drama, the first in New York City on April 24, 1921 and the second in\nWashington D.C. on May 6, 1922. A newspaper article with the headline Give Concert\nto Aid Negro Conservatory, which was published in Musical America (1921), stated the\nfollowing concerning the New York City performance:\nIn the interest of a movement to establish a National Negro School of Music,\nHampton and Tuskegee Institutes combined with the Washington Conservatory of\nMusic in presenting one of the finest expositions of Negro music ever given to\nthis country (Musical America, 1921, p.6).\n\nThe article went on to mention some of the participants including Beatrice Henry and\nKatherine Easmon. It also recognized the compositions of Burleigh, Coleridge-Taylor,\nand Dett. As an overall statement the article said that The program proved a most\neloquent appeal in behalf of the black mans art and revealed splendidly the proficiency\nof African music (Musical America, 1921, p. 6). Unfortunately, Harriet raised only\n$1100 from both performances. Falling so far short of her goal, she realized that it would\ntake considerably more time to raise the $100,000 needed to open the National Negro\nMusic Center.\nHaiti\nIn 1923 Harriet left the conservatory temporarily to move to Haiti where her\nhusband had been appointed cultural attach©. While there she co-founded an industrial\nschool for girls and her experiences led to the publication of her book The Story of Haiti\n(1930). This 177 page book, retrieved from the Bowling Green State University Library,\nwas a detailed history of Haiti from 1485 to 1929. Harriet received excellent reviews for\nher thorough research of Haitian history. One of those reviews was published in the\nJournal of Negro History:\nMrs. Marshalls interest in the history of Haiti was doubtless aroused by living in\nthe country a number of years with her husband who held a position there in\nconnection with the embassy of the United States. While the facts of history set\nforth in the book may be obtained from various works on Haiti, certain\nobservations and methods of treating these phases of the history of the island\nnaturally developed as they would in the mind of one with first hand information.\nIn this respect, therefore, the book has a significance, which some other works\ncannot have (Brewer, 1930, p. 28).\n\nReturn to Washington, D.C.\nIn 1933, after her husbands death, Harriet devoted all her time to the Washington\nConservatory of Music and School of Expression and to raising money for the National\nNegro Music Center. By this time, she had changed the name of the fund to the Samuel\nColeridge-Taylor Memorial fund. Coleridge-Taylor was an African-English composer\nwho had been a huge influence on the African-American musicians at that time, including\nHarriet herself. Her new goal was to raise $5,000 (approximately $72,000 today) to go\ntoward the Center. In order to achieve this goal she wrote The Last Concerto (1936),\nwhich was a drama based on the life and works of Samuel Coleridge-Taylor. The specific\namount raised from this event is unknown, but the National Negro Music Center opened\nsometime after 1937 (Schmalenberger, 2004, pg. 186). However, the end product was\ndifferent from her original vision. Instead of being a research facility, it became a library\nthat featured the publications of black composers that were donated by several major\npublishing companies. The last production was the Masque Musical (1937). This\nprogram was more multicultural than the previous programs, featuring music from\nvarious countries such as Asia, South America, and Europe. It was performed once in\n1937 and again in November of 1940.\nFinal Years\nHarriet continued to direct the Conservatory and National Negro Music Center\nduring her final years even though she was confined to a wheelchair because of\nrheumatoid arthritis. She died on February 25, 1941 at the age of 72. After Harriets\ndeath, her cousin Josephine Muse became director of the Washington Conservatory of\nMusic and School of Expression. The Conservatory closed when Muse died in 1960.\nToday, most of the materials of the Conservatory are housed in Howard Universitys\nMoorland-Springarn Research Center, which is the worlds largest repository devoted to\n\nthe preservation of the African-American heritage (McGinty, 1979, p. 68). As of 2004,\nthe building where the Conservatory was housed was still standing, but in disrepair.",

              "Welcome to the W Washington DC Hotel , at 533 15th St, where once stood the Corcoran Building where the first Baha'i Center was located in Washington. It was here that the Master sent his best translator and the most learned Baha'i Scholar to teach the Faith in 1901. Ali Kuli Khan, the translator, described the center activity as follows, \"Besides our classes, we would address Bahai gatherings in the old Corcoran Building opposite the Treasury Department. Mirza would stand as he spoke, with me at his side. He was a great, spontaneous speaker; he talked with ardour, his voice varying according to his subject, and sometimes very loud. He knew no English, but had an uncanny way of finding out whether my translation was as he wished, and whether it was clear; he could tell from my gestures, and from the effect on the audience. He would speak perhaps five minutes at a time, before pausing for the translation.\" Mirza Abu'l-Fad'l, became the face of the Baha'i Faith for the larger public in newspaper accounts, and, he worked tirelessly to produce the book the Master had sent him to DC to write \"The Baha'i Proofs.\" The Corcoran Building was one of the first substantial privately-built and operated office buildings. In 1847 it was the largest 5 story office building in the city and was located next to the White House. It was a commercial monument to William Corcoran, a business pioneer of the District and a founding partner of Corcoran and Riggs, banks, known today as the Riggs National Bank, whose first Corcoran Gallery of Art Mrs. Alice Pike Barney Hemmick helped to establish in their joint pursuit to create Washington as an artistic capitol. In 1917 hotel washington consturcted on the site which has since been replaced by the W Hotel.\n\nHow Ali Kuli Khan and Mirza Abu'l-Fad'l came to DC begins with a pilgrimage Ali Kuli Khan made in 1899:\n\nAfter his pilgrimage, Khan stayed on in the Holy Land serving as a translator, which brought Khan into contact with Pilgrims. In mid-1899 he had the totally new experience of meeting Occidental Baha'is. One of those who came to see 'Abdu'l-Baha as a pilgrim from the United States was Mrs. Charlotte Emilie Dixon founder of the Washington, DC Bahai community. She was accompanied by her sister and her two daughters, Louise and Elanor. Khan had never seen an American family before. When in the following year, 'Abdu'l-Baha sent Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, and also Khan to Washington DC to write a book called Bahai Proofs, Khan became close friends with the same Dixon family he met on their pilgrimage.\n\nOne day in 1900 the Master looked at Khan with a wonderful, loving expression in His eyes and, smiling tenderly, He said, \"You cannot conceive what power is going to be yours in the future when you speak of the Faith. Forget your present difficulty. The day will come when, without any preparation, you will speak to large gatherings. The more numerous the people, the better you will speak. You will deliver the Message to hundreds, to thousands, no, to millions!\" (He would later speak to millions via the medium of the Radio)\n\nKhan's Muslim mother wished Khan to return home and establish his career like the rest of his family, the Master replied lovingly, \"Write your mother and tell her you will surely return at a future time, when your coming will rejoice her heart. But you should also make it known to her', the Master said, 'that now you are about to be sent on a long journey, to a far away country where you will do a great work that will bring you fame, for it will identify you with a great Cause, a Cause devoted to the welfare of all humankind. You will come back to her in a matter of years, tell her, when your name and fame will confer blessings upon her and on all the family.\"\n\nOne morning thereafter in 1900 Haifa, 'Abdu'l-Baha sent for Khan to meet Him at the little house on the German Colony street. He told Khan that two American ladies had arrived from Paris and were staying at the German hotel near the sea, and Khan was to call on them and escort them to the house. One of the two cousins, Elsa (Laura) Barney was from Washington DC, further strengthening his connection to that city. Khan had begun to hear that by special request of Elsa (Laura) Barney of Washington DC, the Master had agreed to send Mirza Abul-Fadl to America to unfold the true teachings of Bahaullah and interpret the prophecies of the Holy Scriptures, the key to which Mirza had found in the book of Iqan.\n\nTo console Khan on his coming journey the Master said :\n\n\"I will be with you at all times. You must go forth now and give to others the bounties that have been given you here.\"\n\nNext, Laura Barney who had met Khan in Haifa during her 1901 pilgrimage there, arranged for their arrival. In December 1901, Laura sent a telegram to Mirza Abu'l-Fadl and Ali Kuli-Khan, telling them that she had engaged quarters for them in Washington DC. Throughout Khans stay in Washington Laura was his confident and friend. Mirza Abul-Fadl also held Laura in very high regard. When their work was ready, in 1902, it was Laura who convinced her mother Alice Pike Barney to own the copyright and arrange for the publishing of Abu'l-Fadl's \"Baha'i Proofs.\" She further strengthened the DC community by covering all the meeting hall rental costs of the Bahai community in DC in 1903.\n\nNow, with Mirza and Khan in Washington, Mrs. Phoebe Hearst was anxious to discuss with them various plans for promoting the Faith. For one thing, she felt Khan should enroll at Harvard, the better to equip himself for future services. Khan explained that the Master had sent him to America to translate Bahai writings, including Mirzas book, and that he was working at least fifteen hours a day. Since, however, Mrs. Hearst had been accepted as a Bahai by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself and had received from Him the title Mother of the Faithful, Mirza thought her suggestion should be communicated immediately to the Master.\n\nIt was from this address that the first letters were sent to the Shah in defence of the Believers in Iran. On in 1907 bearing the address on its letterhead was sent to Ali-Mohammed Shah from the Baha'i Assembly of Washington. Earlier, in the summer of 1902, two Bahais had been martyred at Abargu, and a cable asked American Bahais to appeal to the Shah. And the Bahai Board of Council did so. These telegrams of complaint were sent to the Shah, causing him to instruct postal and telegraph offices not to accept petitions from Bahais.\n\n\nMirza Abul-Fadl, \"HIS HONOR\"\n\nMirza Abu'l-Fad'l was the outstanding scholar of the Bahai Faith of the period. Although he was vital to the growth of the Cairo Bahai community and elsewhere, he was sent by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the United States to help strengthen the believers love and knowledge of God in 1900. Abul-Fadls instructions from the Master were to begin by writing his book, The Bahai Proofs, with Khan translating whatever was written each day. Mirza wrote in Arabic, in a style and depth which he alone could command.\n\nMirza Abu'l-Fad'l also received a great deal of mail, sometimes hundreds of letters, from American Bahais asking him questions on all aspects of the Faith, being the utmost authority on the Bahai teachings in the nation. In addition to all his other work, he together with Ali Kuli Khan, his translator, held a class for seekers each afternoon at three. Mirza kept up with the writing, regular public meetings, classes and greeting visitors.\n\nMirza Abu'l-Fad'l begins his book when it was published in 1902 by Laura Barneys mother in New York, with a description of the command of 'Abdu'l-Baha to write it: An illustrious Command hath been issued form the Holy Court, that I should compile for you a book for the solution of the allegories of the Heavenly Scriptures and interpretation of the intricacies in the texts of the Divine and Holy Writings.\n\nMirza Abu'l-Fad'l, loved Washington. The quiet, the sunshine, the flowering springtimes, the inviting parks. Together with his translator Ali Kuli Khan, the two of them were familiar figures in the northwestern section of the city: Mirza, old, with his patriarchal beard, white turban and flowing robes; Khan, young, in his carefully selected Western dress. They both provided DC with Bahai sources of knowledge unlike those found anywhere else in America at the turn of the century. Upon his passing in Cairo, Egypt the DC community sent a letter of condolence and sympathy to 'Abdu'l-Baha expressing their grief and affliction. In reply, 'Abdu'l-Baha expressed that the letter conferred consolation, but also made clear Abu'l-Fad'ls station: Praise be to God! that the believers of Washington are informed of the majesty of the station of that noble personage. With weeping eyes and burning hearts they moaned and lamented at the Memorial meetings commemorating his departure. This glorious personage was a brilliant orb, a luminous lamp, a blessed, fruitful tree, a waving sea of knowledge, a fountain of the Water of Life and was established in the Ark of Salvation.\nThe Master Bahai scholar, and one time D.C. resident, Mirza Abul-Fadl, provides an illuminating perspective on the same trip the of 'Abdu'l-Baha to America:\n\nIndeed, let them merely consider the talks, Tablets, answers, and discussions of the Master of the worlds which flowed form the most holy pen during this journey to the vast regions of Europe and America in gatherings, meetings, churches, and schools at the request of great sages and philosophers, priests, and leaders. Let them compare these with the writings of former times, that they may discover the difference between two letters and twenty-five, or between one and seventy. They would see the distinction between a very light drizzle and a thundering downpour... These holy talks were not delivered after meditation and deliberation, or at leisure not at all. Rather, in every situation they were revealed intuitively, spontaneously, extemporaneously, powerfully, and independently. For visitors and the public left that holy being no time or opportunity to ponder their questions.... Naturally, the kindliness of the exponent of the Cause of God forbade that he should deprive them or offer them excuses or pleasantries. Not at morning, noon, or night did the ill and feeble frame of that exemplar of loving-kindness and compassion have an opportunity to rest, that he might have time to meditate or ponder.\n\n\nThe Master wrote the following, to a believer moving to Washington regarding Mirza 'Abu'l-Fad'l:\n\n\n\"O thou who art desirous of the Kingdom of God!\n\nThy letter was the cause of happiness and its contents were the proof of thy turning to the Shining Beauty. In this blessed period, when the light of the endless bounties is illuminating the dark world, some souls, like the butterfly, circled round the Divine Lamp and with perfect yearning sacrificed their lives.\n\nI ask of God that thou mayest be one of those souls, so that the rays of knowledge will shine forth from thy face to those regions and will be the cause of guiding the seekers of Reality.\n\nThough thou wert obliged to leave Baltimore, I hope that thou wilt be the cause of guidance in Washington (D.C.). Receive proofs and evidence from Mirza Abu'l Fazl so that thou wilt be armed with convincing proofs and sufficient argument to break down the ranks of denial, pride and ignorance.\"\n\n\nPure souls, such as Mirza Abu'l-Fadl, upon him be the Glory of God, spend their nights and days in demonstrating the truth of the Revelation, by adducing conclusive and brilliant proofs and expanding the verities of the Faith, by lifting the veils, promoting the religion of God and spreading His fragrances.\n('Abdu'l-Baha, from a Tablet to an individual believer; the Compilation of Compilations vol II, p. 409)\n\nThe Master, in a tablet to the Washington believers written after Mirza's death in 1914, says of him, 'His blessed heart was the spring of realities and significances, allaying the thirst of every thirsty one.'\n\nSome Vinettes of how Mirza Abu'l-Fad'l Taught in Washington by Ali Kuli Khan his translator\n\n<u>Power of Repetition<\/u>\nWhen explaining a difficult point, he would repeat himself, to drive it home. One day a young believer came to him and said, 'You know, dear Mirza, we are an intelligent people. If you tell us a thing once, we grasp it. But if you keep repeating yourself, the way you did last night, people will surely criticize you, and us.' He thanked her, very humbly. 'It was only to make the matter clear,' he said. 'But I appreciate what you have told me. Now, just one question. What was I repeating, last night?' The young woman thought for a while; then she said, 'I don't remember.' 'That is why I repeat myself,' said Mirza.\n<u>Backbiting<\/u>\nMirza never encouraged any talk which might lead to inharmony. Once, a friend came to him and said that another believer was doing harm to the Faith. Mirza listened carefully. Then he told me to translate his answer word for word:\n'Do you believe that Bah¡'u'll¡h is the promised Lord of Hosts?'\n'Yes'.\n'Well, if He is that Lord, these are the Hosts. What right have we to speak ill of the Hosts?'\n\n\n<u>Mohammad<\/u>\nA churchman came to him and violently attacked the Prophet Muhammad. Mirza said to him: 'Your leading authorities state that none of the Jewish or Roman historians of the First Century even mention Jesus, and many do not believe in the historicity of Christ. Certain Christians inserted a reference to Christ in the writings of Josephus, but the forgery was exposed. Others buried a tablet in China, which said that Christianity had been brought to that country in the First Century. This, too, was exposed. But as for the Prophet Muhammad, He not only proclaimed the existence of a historical Christ, but He caused three hundred million people to believe in Him; to accept Him not only as a historical figure but also as the Spirit of God (Ruhu'llah). Was not Muhammad, whom you condemn, a more successful Christian missionary than your own?'\n<u>On his book Baha'i Proofs<\/u>\nThe American friends wonder why it consists of 'Introductions.' This is not only the classic convention of Eastern scholars, but in addition, Mirza contemplated a greater book. What we have here is nothing compared to the flow of his knowledge. The Master directed Mirza to write the book and me to translate it, and in spite of failing health and every difficulty he did not leave America until it was finished. He was a careful, painstaking stylist, and yet he wrote very rapidly, with no corrections, no crossing out. He would put up one knee, and lean his paper on it in the Persian way, and write with a reed pen.\n\n<u>Receiving Guests<\/u>\nWe had a great deal to do--classes--meetings--innumerable visitors to see. Speaking of visitors, whenever they brought flowers and fruit to him, he was violently displeased. He would say: 'Why do they bring these things for me? I am only the slave of the slaves of Bah¡'u'll¡h!' I would not translate these expressions of his humility, because I knew that our guests would only attribute them to pride. I would thank the givers, and explain to Mirza why I could not translate what he had said.\n\n<u>On Mirza<\/u>\n\nI was overwhelmed by the Master's command to carry on his work in this country.\nIt is a long time now since he died, and the Master and the believers mourned his going. But I can see him still, as if he were here before me. A rather tall, spare figure, in a white turban and light-brown robes. Beautiful hands--artistic and sensitive, but at the same time intellectual and executive hands. A high forehead, somewhat high cheek bones, an ascetic look, a faint smell of rose water. And then the small, very black, very keen eyes. Yes, but really to know his greatness, you had to watch him when he was in the presence of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Then His knowledge reduced him to nothingness, and you thought of a pebble on the ocean shore.\n\n\n\n\n\nMirza Abul-Fadl Gulpaygani One of 19 Apostles of Bahaullah, the most outstanding scholar of the Bahai Faith (Bahai Dictionary by Wendi Momen) and a very excellent and erudite Bahai teacher (Shoghi Effendi, The Unfolding Destiny of the British Baha'i Community) 1844-1914\n\n\n\nby Ishteal Ebn-Kalanter, 1914\n\nMirza Abul-Fadl was born in 1844 in Galpaygan, a small Persian town founded by Humay, the daughter of Darius [an ancient Persian king]. The family to which his parents belonged was one of the most distinguished of that city, and, even to the present time [1914], is well known for learning and knowledge. [His given name at birth was Muhammad, but later in life he became known as Abu'l-Fadl, which means the father of virtue. After he became a Bahai, Abdu'l-Baha frequently addressed him as Abu'l-Fada'il, which means the father of virtues] His father, Mirza-Reza, was one of the most noted Shi'ite doctors of religion in Persia; he died in 1871, at the age of seventy.\n\nIn the prime of youth, Mirza Abul-Fadl traveled to Isfahan and Iraq, with the object of perfecting his studies. Even in his boyhood he was noted for intelligence, sound memory, and diligence in discovering subtle scientific points, to such an extent that these qualities seemed to the people supernatural.\n\nBefore he was twenty-two years of age, Mirza Abul-Fadl had perfected himself in the branches of Arabic learning, such as grammar, rhetoric, etymology and composition; although Arabic is a foreign language to Persians. In accordance with the wishes of his father, he also acquired a perfect knowledge of Mohammedan theology and laws. At the same time he studied mathematic, algebra, arithmetic, geometry, and astronomy according to the Ptolemian system. He also mastered the Aristotelian as well as the rational Mohammedan philosophy.\nIn October, 1873, he left the town of Gulpaygan, and went to Tehran, the capital of Persia, where he took up his residence. A short time after his arrival, he was appointed the superintendent and professor of one of the oldest first Arabic Universities of Teheran, named \"School of Hakim-Hashem.\" There, students of different sciences gathered around him and attended his lectures.\n\nIn 1875 he became acquainted with a merchant named Aqa-Abdul-Karim of Isfahan, an adherent of the Bahai Religion. As this merchant found Mirza Abul-Fadl sagacious and free from prejudice, he invited him to investigate his religion. Although Aqa-Abdul-Karirn had no schooling, yet he possessed a shrewd, acute mind and an excellent character. He arranged interviews for Mirza Abul-Fadl with learned Bahai teachers, such as his holiness the great Nabil, entitled \"The Learned One of Kaeern,\" the late Haji Muhammad-Ismail of Kashan, entitled \"Zabih\" [sacrificed], Aqa- Mirza Haydar-Ali of Ardistan, and others. They continued the controversy and religious and scientific debate during eight months. Finally, in September, 1876, after this ample discussion and tedious argument, Mirza Abul-Fadl, finding himself unable to refute and resist the proofs and demonstrations of the Bahais, and esteeming the evidences of this movement stronger than the proofs of other religions, acknowledged and embraced the truth of the Religion of Bahaullah, and became a convert to it.\n\nWhen Mirza Abul-Fadl acknowledged the truth of this religion, and, on account of the straightforwardness for which he was noted, could not conceal his belief, he openly propounded proofs and arguments of the truth of the Bahai Faith, in his lectures to the students. Consequently, enemies who were jealous of him, always waiting to accomplish his downfall, availed themselves of this opportunity to speak of him in the presence of the clergy and prominent statesmen of Teheran. The clergy denounced him, and, in December of the same year, first he was arrested and put in chains by the command of Prince Kamran-Mirza, entitled Nayyebul-Sultan (Prince Regent), the third son of the late Nasirid-Din Shah, who was then the governor of Teheran, Guilan and Mazandaran. This imprisonment lasted about five months. As a result of this imprisonment he lost all the property which he had inherited from his father. At the end of five months, he and other Bahais imprisoned with him on account of their faith, were released, owing to the efforts of the late Haji Mirza Husayn-Khan, entitled Mushire-Dawla, who was then Minister of War. Upon his release, the clergy of Teheran tried their utmost to persuade him to verbally acknowledge Mohammedanism, and not to openly uphold the truth of the Bahai Religion. To this he would not agree, and patiently endured the most violent persecutions and afflictions rather than accede to the clergy and statesmen. Afterward he gained his living by means of his pen, and diligently labored in spreading the Bahai Religion.\n\nIn 1300 A.H (1882 A.D), came a great historical calamity. Large numbers of Bahais were arrested in various Persian cities, for now this religion had become very prevalent throughout Persia and the Caucasus. A considerable number of the nobility, comprising Mohammedans, Jews, Zoroastrians, Nusseyrites, et al., had embraced it with the utmost sincerity, and even did not recant when in danger of their lives. Consequently the fire of envy and hatred flamed anew in the clergy and statesmen of Teheran, who considered themselves defenders of the first-named religion.\n\nThey agreed with the Prince Kamran-Mirza to persecute the Bahais. So they falsely accused and calumniated them before the Shah. Also in Resht, Isfahan and Mazandaran, most of the clergy and statesmen determined to eradicate the Bahais, and arrested a great number. Among these was Mirza Abul-Fadl, who was arrested in Teheran, along with a multitude of the Bahais of prominence, merchants, traders, et al. He was confined for about one month in the house of the Prince, and several controversial meetings and debates were held in the presence of the Prince, concerning this Religion.\n\nThe opponents of the Bahais, consisting principally of members of the royal family, religious doctors and statesmen, constantly accused them of sedition and plots. Great efforts were made to alienate the mind of the Shah from them and to persuade him to decree their suppression and slaughter. But as they could not be charged with any violation of the laws of the Government, the Shah became convinced of their innocence, and would not consent to sentence them to death, but commanded them to be put in chains in the royal prison. Thus Mirza Abul-Fadl and a number of the stanch Bahais were imprisoned in chains and fetters for twenty-two months, subject to rigorous distress and hardship. During most of this time, nobody was allowed to see them. Twenty four of them were, for fourteen days, chained to two long, heavy chains in a dark underground dungeon. Mirra Abul-Fadl relates that for about six months they received daily news of the plots and intrigues of their enemies, and expected death at any moment, having entirely resigned themselves to the will of God.\n\nAfter the lapse of twenty-two months, the falseness of the accusations of the enemy was proven to the Shah, and he commanded that the prisoners should be set free.\n\nReleased from this rigorous imprisonment Mirza Abul-Fadl took up his residence in the village of Gholo-hak, one of the well-known and delightful summer resorts of Teheran, where he remained about seven months, engagedvin lecturing and writing. Again thevPrince found excuse for his arrest, a third time. He was imprisoned for six months in the royal building named Otake-Nezam (the military department), whence he was released on February 5th. 1886.\n\n**********\n\nFor about thirty years, Mirza Abul-Fadl traveled in remote countries. He journeyed northward through Persia, Turkey, the Caucasus,Tartary and Russia, as far Moscow; eastward as far as the confines of China and Kash-Kar; to Syria and Egypt; and in 1901-1902 made a trip through Western Europe and America. During his arduous travels, he everywhere secured a good name for himself and his countrymen; he consorted with the men of learning of different religions, nationalities and schools; and acquired a vast range of knowledge which it would have been impassible to attain without undertaking extensive and toilsome journeys.\n\nIn 1303 A.H (1886 A.D), he received the Tablet written by Bahaullah in 1300 A.H, in which he was commanded to travel for the purpose of teaching the Word of God; and during his distant journeys, undertaken in compliance with this Command, many holy Tablets were revealed in praise of his strength and fidelity to the Cause.\n\nWhile travelling, he has written numerous books, being considered a standard writer in ancient and modern Persian, as well as in Arabic. In 1892, Mirza Abul-Fadl wrote, in Samarkand, the book entitled Fassl-ul-Khetab (Conclusive Proof), in answer to questions asked by Mirza Heydar-Ali of Tabriz, one of the learned men of Azarbeyjan. This book he wrote in the style of the doctors of theology, and in the introduction is an account of the controversy in Samarkand between himself and Dr. Marcard Assadorian, a Protestant teacher, in a meeting held by men of learning.\n\nIn 1898, he wrote the book of El- Fara'id in Persian, in compliance with the command of 'Abdu'l-Baha. In this work, he answers the objections of Shaykh-Abdus-Salam, entitledvShaykh-El-Islam (a Mohammedan pontiff) of Tiflis. The same year, he wrote the book of ad-Dur-arul-Bahiyyih (The Brilliant Pearls), in Arabic, in answer to Dr. Noor-Edin of India [translated in English as Miracles and Metaphors].\n\nDuring the years 1901 and 1902, while sojourning in America, Mirra Abul-Fazl wrote the al Hujajul-Bahaiyyih (The Bahai Proofs), which was translated into English by Ish'te'a'l Ebn-Kalanter, and publishrd at that time. This work is well known to the scholars and thinkers of the Western world.\n\nAs late as December, 1911, he wrote a scholarly answer to an opponent of the Bahai Cause, known as Burhan Lame (The Brilliant Proof), which was published by The Center of The Covenant, 'Abdu'l-Baha, while in America.\n\nHis other epistles and pamphlets, which are scattered in all parts, are too numerous for mention in this article.\n\n***********\n\nOne of the theories originated by Mirza Abul-Fadl was the \"Proof of Stability,\" in demonstrating the Essence of the Self-existent One. This is one of the greatest and clearest logical arguments for proving the Divine validity of the religions and demonstrating the Essence of the Almighty. By a single rational proof, it demonstrates both the existence of God and the truth of the true Prophets. He first propounded this argument in the book of Fassl-ul-Khetab, in 1892, and for the second time, in the book of El- Fara'id, in 1897.\n\nHe was the first one of the Bahais who demonstrated by rational and logical arguments, that miracles are not sufficient to prove the truth of the Manifestations of God. He was the first one who clearly explained the purpose of what was spoken by the Prophets, in the Holy Scriptures, as to the \"words being sealed,\" to he opened at the \"last days.\"* He was also the first to explain that the great religions of the world which have changed and governed the conditions of society, are seven in number; and that the \"seven heavens\" is a term by which the Prophets have symbolized the Divine religions. Before Mirza Abul-Fadl propounded his theory, the point was not understood, for this number was not spoken of in the Divine Books and Tablets, nor in historical works.\n\nHe was the first one who demonstrated by rational proofs, why the Pagan religions are considered as polytheism, although they owe their origin to the Almighty, and acknowledge one God. For if by worshipping images, people are to be considered as polytheists, the Greek Church and Roman Catholics must also be considered such, while they are in reality, the \"people of the Book,\" and believers in Divine Unity and true Religion.\n\nMirza Abul-Fadl had a wonderful genius in explaining subtle philosophical points, which skill was his speciality. He himself thought that he received this gift as a fulfillment of the prayer which the Blessed Perfection [Bahaullah] made for him in a Tablet written to Haji Muhammad-Kazen of Isfahan. It is as follows:-- \"I beg of God to enable Fadl [Mirza Abul-Fadl) to teach His Truth, and to unveil that which is hidden and treasured in His Knowledge, with wisdom and explanation. Verily He is the Mighty, the Bestower!\" (Star of the West, vol. IV, no.19, March 2, 1914)\n\nA Glimpse of Mirza Abul-Fadl at Ramleh, Egypt\nby Isabel Fraser, Chicago, February 26, 1914\n\nA glimpse into the last days of Mirza Abul-Fadl, as I saw him at Ramleh, a suburb of Alexandria, Egypt, last autumn may be of interest. When 'Abdu'l-Baha settled at Ramleh, He desired to have his old friend, Mirza Abul-Fadl, near Him. To do so he rented the upper part of a two-story house set in a garden of date palms. To have provided a more pretentious place would not have been at all in accordance with Mirza Abul-Fadls modest habits. Here he lived alone. At first, 'Abdu'l-Baha secured a cook who was to act as personal caretaker, for Mirza Abul-Fadl's health was failing and he needed such an attendant.\n\nBut sick or well, the old philosopher was a hermit. He loved his circle of friends, and he also loved his hours of solitude and contemplation. He was not used to having anybody constantly around administering to what he regarded as merely trivial needs; but he soon discovered a way to compromise with the unaccustomed situation. One day when 'Abdu'l-Baha called, He found his venerable friend waiting upon the servant and treating him as though he were an honored guest. Seeing that was only an added burden to Mirza Abul-Fadl, He had the man dismissed.\n\nMirza Abul-Fadl's quarters resembled an un-kept library. There were books on every conceivable shelf and table, and even the floor was littered with volumes and papers. His place was a rendezvous for the learned sheiks and Muhammadan mullahs of the ancient city of Aexandria; for he was looked upon as an authority on history, Persian literature, higher criticism and comparative religions.\n\nHis favorite outing was a visit to the house of 'Abdu'l-Baha's secretaries which was just around the corner, and which beside housing the secretaries, was used as a guest-house for visiting pilgrims to 'Abdu'l-Baha. Here he would sit on the spacious veranda; the news would go forth and soon a little group would be gathered about him. On Friday afternoons a body of young native students from Alexandria came to him for lessons in the Sacred Books of Bahaullah.\n\nTo the many who were accorded the rare privilege of meeting this man of letters, both during his stay in America and on their pilgrimages to the East, I need not speak of his peculiar personal charm. With all his book learning he was not at all \"bookish.\" Gifted with one of those rare minds that explore all the channels of life with equal grace and facility -- the same dignity and impressiveness with which he discussed a verse of the Koran with the learned sheiks, he put into the meeting some sojourning American; often finishing with a personal pleasantry, for he was a ready humorist and made his guests instantly at ease. He had the placidness of a child and the air of one who was never in a hurry and had plenty of time to make radiantly happy the place where God had placed him.\n\nThat was his attitude toward the world; but in the presence of the Center of The Covenant, 'Abdu'l-Baha, with head bowed and downcast eyes, he became the essence of humility. Even his voice, in answer to 'Abdu'l-Baha's questions, became low and subdued. Never have I seen such a perfect and instantaneous agreement of mind and body to express humility.\n\nOne day when I was at his house, there were about twenty sheiks who had come over from Alexandria to visit him. One who seemed to be the leader was a very learned and gorgeously attired young sheik, who said with some pride that he had been educated in the oldest university in the world. He was the editor of a magazine in Alexandria and had come to interview Mirza Abul-Fadl, who for more than an hour had been listened to with absorbed attention. His talk was interspersed with an occasional jest and his sharp eye would glance from one face to another to see if his point was understood. One might imagine the learned devotees in the early Christian era listening like this to the elequence of St. Paul.\n\nSuddenly Abdul-Bah appeared. Mirza Abul- Fadl faced the door, the rest of us had our backs to it and did not see Him; there was a moment of silence and Mirza Abul-Fadl stood with his head bowed, his whole attitude changed. He immediately became the most humble and respectful of servitors. Then quickly arranging a chair for 'Abdu'l-Baha, He told him in a low voice, in answer to His questions, the subject under discussion.\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha continued the subject, which was on the independent search for reality, further emphasizing the great necessity of investigating truth with a mind unbiased by theology or the limitations of other minds.\n\nAt the house of Mirza Abul-Fadl He was an almost daily visitor. Whenever inquiry was made for Abbas EEendi, as the natives all call 'Abdu'l-BahaBaha, the conjecture invariably was that He was to be found either at the of house of Mirza Abul-Fadl or in the rose garden opposite, dictating Tablets.\n\n'Abdu'l-Bahas love for His old friend, who for years had suffered banishment, imprisonment and persecution for his faith, was remarked by all. He said of him one day: \"Such men as Mirza Abul-Fadl already belong to the Divine Concourse. All his interests are centered on the spiritual horizon rather than on this transitory phantasmagoria. All his efforts are turned toward the heavenly kingdom. He has no other though. Such souls ore aided by heavely confirmations. (Star of the West, vol. IV, no.19, March 2, 1914)\n\nMirza Abul-Fadls Works in Arabic and Persian\nBy Moojan Momen\n\na. Sharh-i-Ayat-i-Mu'arrakhih (\"In Explanation of Sacred Verses that Prophesy Dates\"), a work on the prophecies in the scriptures of Islam, Christianity, Judaism, and Zoroastrianism about the date of the coming of the Promised One. It was written at the request of Muhammad Mahdi Mirza Mu'ayyadu's-Saltanih in Hamadan in 1888. It was published twice: once on its own in India, and once with the Risalih Ayyubiyyih in Shanghai in 1344\/1925.\n\nb. Risalih Ayyubiyyih (Treatise addressed to Ayyub). While Gulpaygani was in Hamadan, a great many Jews inquired about the Baha'i Faith. One Baha'i of Jewish background, Hakim Mirza Ayyub wrote to Gulpaygani from Tehran asking him a number of questions related to the Torah and the prophecies relating to the coming of the Promised One. This treatise was sent in reply in 1305\/1887.\n\nc. Faslu'l-Khitab (The Decisive Utterance). This was a large book written by Gulpaygani in Samarqand in 1308\/1892 in reply to an attack by a fundamentalist Shi`i cleric of Adharbayjan which was forwarded to Gulpaygani by Mirza Haydar `Ali Usku'i. Much of the subject matter resembles the Fara'id. One of the subjects dealt with is the question of why there are Traditions in the Shi`i books that point both to the persecution and even martyrdom of the Promised One and to his triumph. At present no copy of this is known.\n\nd. Fara'id (The Peerless Gems). This book which is generally considered Gulpaygani's greatest was composed in six months, being completed in February 1898. It was written in reply to an attack on the Book of Certitude (q.v.) by the Shaykhu'l-Islam of Tiflis, Mirza Hasan Tahirzadih `Abdu's-Salam. It was published in Cairo in 1315\/1898 and sparked off some seven or eight rebuttals of it by Iranian `ulama. (For a summary of its contents, see \"Apologetics and Introductory Literature.1.a.\")\n\ne. Al-Duraru'l-Bahiyyih (The Shining Pearls). A collection of essays on the history of religion in Arabic, published in Cairo by Shaykh Faraju'llah Kurdi in 1900. As it was in Arabic, it was responsible for making him generally known as a Baha'i in Egypt. (It has been translated into English by Juan Cole as Miracles and Metaphors.) The \"Risaliyyih Iskandaraniyyih\" written for Husayn Ruhi, giving proofs for the prophethood of Muhammad from the Christian and Jewish scriptures, and a treatise in explanation of the verse of the Qur'an \"Then it is ours to explain it\" (Q 75:19), were published together with Ad-Durar al-Bahiyyih (and are included in the English translation).\n\nf. The Kitab-i-Ibrar (Book of Justification). This book is referred to in a few of Gulpaygani's works and evidently dealt with the issue of the Covenant (q.v.). No manuscript of it, however, appears to be extant.\n\ng. Al-Hujaju'l-Baha'iyyih (The Baha'i Proofs). This was the book that Gulpaygani composed in America (see 6 above) in which he gives a defense and exposition of the Faith from a Christian point of view. It was translated by Ali Kuli Khan and published in New York in 1902 as The Behai Proofs. It was for many years, until the publication of Esslemont's Baha'u'llah and the New Era, the standard Baha'i textbook in America. The English translation also includes a short treatise on the history of the Baha'i Faith which Gulpaygani wrote while at Green Acre.\n\nh. Burhan-i-Lami` (The Brilliant Proof). A pamphlet written in reply to a Christian clergyman, Peter Easton. It was printed in Chicago in 1912 with English translation.\n\ni. Kashfu'l-Ghita' (The Uncovering of Error). When E.G. Browne published the Nuqtatu'l-Kaf with its Persian and English introductions that contained much material hostile to the Baha'i Faith, a number of Baha'i scholars worked on refutations of this book. Gulpaygani also began to work on such a book, but when heard that work on a similar book in Iran under the guidance of the Hands of the Cause (q.v.) had reached an advanced stage, he suspended work on his book awaiting a manuscript from Iran. Unfortunately he never got back to this book and at his death the manuscript was incomplete. When Mirza Abu'l-Fadl's papers were sent to his cousin Sayyid Mahdi Gulpaygani in Ashkhabad, the latter undertook to complete the work. The final work was published in Ashkhabad. Of the 438 pages of the book some 132 are attributed to Mirza Abu'l-Fadl. The final work, however, has a tone and vehemence completely uncharacteristic of Mirza Abu'l-Fadl and `Abdu'l-Baha instructed that it should not be distributed.\n\nThere are numerous shorter epistles of Gulpaygani written in answer to specific questions addressed to him; some of these have been published in a number of compilations of his works:\n\nj. Majmu`iy-i-Rasa'il-i-Hadrat-i-Abi'l-Fadl. Published in Cairo in 1920 by Shaykh Muhiyu'd-Din Kurdi. Contains 16 letters and treatises.\n\nk. Rasa'il wa Raqa'im. Compiled by Ruhu'llah Mihrabkhani and published in Tehran in 1977. It contains 23 treatises, followed by four groups of letters (containing seven letters, thirty-six letters, five letters, and eleven letters respectively). Some of the treatises in this volume have been translated into English by Juan Cole in Letters & Essays. Among these treatises are:\n\ni. Two treatises on the Covenant. In 1329\/1911, a work was published in Cairo consisting of two treatises, a longer one, written in 1317\/1899, and a shorter one, written in 1314\/1896. These deal with the actions of the Covenant-breakers (q.v.), and bring forward proofs from the Bible and Qur'an for the Covenant and the position of `Abdu'l-Baha (Rasa'il 9-28).\n\nii. \"Risalih Iskandariyyih\" (Treatise of Alexander). This treatise was written in Samarqand in reply to a request of E.G. Browne (q.v.), that Gulpaygani write something of the history of the life of Baha'u'llah, explain a point that he had made in the Ayyubiyyih, and identify the author of the Tarikh-i-Jadid. Gulpaygani named it in honor of Alexander Tumanski who had also requested information about Baha'u'llah (Rasa'il 48-89; Letters 43-83).\n\niii. \"Al-Bab wa'l-Babiyyih\" (The Bab and Babism). After the episode in Egypt following the assassination of Nasiru'd-Din Shah, the editor of the magazine Al-Muqtataf, Dr. Ya`qub Sarruf, commissioned this brief account of the history of the Baha'i Faith (Rasa'il 291-303; Letters 95-109).\n\niv. \"Risalah at-Tarablusiyyih\" (Letter to Tripoli). Written in reply to questions regarding the previous treatise (Rasa'il 182-201; Letters 111-34).\n\nv. A treatise that Gulpaygani wrote on the genealogy of Baha'u'llah was confiscated when he was arrested in Tehran 1882 and thus lost, but years later a Baha'i wrote to `Abdu'l-Baha asking about this question and `Abdu'l-Baha referred him to Gulpaygani, who wrote a second, shorter treatise, tracing Baha'u'llah's ancestry to the last Sasanian king, Yazdigird III, a document that was of great importance in the conversion of the Zoroastrians (Rasa'il 41-47).\n\nl. Mukhtarat min Mu'allafat Abi'l-Fada'il. A compilation of works in Arabic (Maison d'Editions Baha'ies, Brussels, 1980), including Al-Hujaj al-Bahiyyih, and twelve other treatises, including \"at-Tarablusiyyih,\" \"al-Bab wa'l-Babiyyih,\" and others mentioned above.\n\nA number of Gulpaygani's works which are known from references to them in other writings are, however, lost. Among the papers sent to Ashkhabad and subsequently lost were a number of treatises mostly incomplete: a reply to Muhammad Khan Kirmani, the Shaykhi leader who had written a refutation of the Fara'id; and Raddu'r-Rudud (Refutation of the Refutations), a reply to the various refutations of the Fara'id that had been written. Among Gulpaygani's works are also several that are not Baha'i works, including Anjuman-i-Danish, a book of biographies of scholars and litterateurs, which was probably lost when he was arrested in Tehran in 1882; and a history of Iran, which were among the papers sent to Ashkhabad after his death.\n\nApart from the works already mentioned, he was involved in the composition of The New History of the Bab (Tarikh-i-Jadid). He carried on a vast correspondence, often answering questions on the interpretation of scripture referred to him by `Abdu'l-Baha, and typescripts of his lectures were an important source of information about the Baha'i Faith for the American Baha'i community for the first decade of the twentieth century.\n(Religious Studies and Baha'i Studies by Moojan Momen at: http:\/\/www.northill.demon.co.uk\/relstud\/index.htm)\n\n\nThe Death of Mirza Abul-Fadl\n\nBy Hussein A. Afnan, Egypt, February 2, 1914\n\n\"VERILY TH E EYES HAVE SHED TEARS AND TH E HEARTS HAVE BURNED BECAUSE OF THIS GREAT AFFLICTION. BE YE POSSESSED WITH THE BEAUTY O F PATIENCE IN THIS MIGHTY CALAMITY.\" (Telegram from 'Abdu'l-Baha referring to the passing of Abul-Fadl)\n\nA few days before 'Abdu'l-Baha's departure from Egypt to the Holy Land, Mirza Abul-Fadl went to Cairo. During the month of January, which is the coldest in Cairo, his strength failed rapidly and when finally confined to his bed, he was transferred to the house of one of the friends, Aqa Muhammad Taqi of Isfahan where he was attended by the best physicians and nurses procurable. But he never rallied, and died on Wednesday, January 21, 1914, at four o'clock in the afternoon. The attending nurse said that as he expired she heard him say, \"Khoda! Khoda!\" [God! God!]. With these words of greeting he joined Him in whose service he bad so long labored.\n\nThe doctor pronounced death due to endcarditis i.e., inflammation of the lining membrane of the heart.\n\nAlthough he had passed the allotted years of three score and ten, it was hard for us to believe this busy life ended. As no one bad ever met him without hearing him utter a few words of wisdom, it was difficult to realize that the spirit had indeed departed from the body that lay before us, silent and irresponsive, yet smiling and beautiful.\n\nA telegram was sent to 'Abdu'l-Baha notifying Him of the death of Mirza Abul-Fadl, and the answer, quoted above, came immediately.\n\nThe body of our beloved teacher was carried on the shoulders of the Bahais of Egypt, from the house of Aqa Muhammad Taqi to the cemetery on the hill and laid in the tomb owned by Mirza Haji Hasan Khorassani. The tomb is a large room, in the center of which the remains were laid, and fragrant narcissus blossoms were scattered on his resting place. The friends chanted Tablets and many eyes were wet with tears.\n\nAnd thus, on January 22nd, while the Egyptian people were celebrating the inauguration of the Legislative Council in one end of the city of Cairo, at the other end, on a hill, a group of old and young men, Persians and Egyptians, were mourning the departure of a soul well loved throughout the East.\n\nAccording to the Moslem custom, a large tent was erected in front of Aqa Muhammad Taqi's house, in memoriam of the deceased, and people gathered there during the night to hear the Koran read by the Shaykhs.\n\nAt Port Said, Alexandria and Acca the friends gathered and read Tablets and Communes. Plans are being made to hold a memorial meeting in Cairo on the fortieth day after Mirza Abul-Fadls departure.\n(Star of the West, vol. IV, no.19, March 2, 1914)",

              "Welcome to the Greater New Hope Baptist Church, at 816 Eighth Street, where the Master addressed the Washington Hebrew Congregation in their synagogue which has since become a church. On November the 8th, the Master spoke to the Washington Hebrew Congregation about the oneness of the foundation of spiritual truth as taught by all the Prophets. This caused some to leave and others to remain restless. Nonetheless the Master finished His message and afterwards the Rabbi Simon explained to the congregation, \"We must not be perplexed at whatever contradicts our own convictions and beliefs. Rather, we must, with perfect composure and sincerity, investigate reality so that we may find out the truth of everything.\" On November 9th, the Rabbi Simon visited the Master at 4 PM at Mrs. Parsons, where the Master further explained, \"Whenever these people mention each other's leaders with due reverence then all sufferings and conteions shall cease and instead of hatred there willbe love and instead of enmity and disunity there will be harmony and afeciton. this is my purpose.\" Mrs. Parsons recalls that the Rabbi acknowledged the force of the arguments. Like the Churches which welcomed the Master, this too was the most liberal Synagogue in the city. Formed in 1852, this Washington Reform Judaism congregation declares the basic Jewish declaration of Faith: Hear O Israel. The Lord our god, the Lord is One.\n\nIn 150 years the life of the Washington Hebrew congregation is marked by freedom, justice, tolerance and joy. It is today one of the largest and most influential Congregations in America! May it continue in honor and pride to offer useful service to its community. German Jews formed its nucleus. Jews of Eastern European origin, from Russia and Poland particularly, who have slowly changed from Orthodoxy and Conservatism to Reform, have been a principal source of growth over the years.\n\nBeginning in 1848, and to last one decade, there came to the United States from Germany nearly one million immigrants, most of whom emigrated west. A few arrived in Washington, and of these still fewer were Jews. Those who came numbered at least twenty-one, and on April 25, 1852, at the home of H. Lisberger on Pennsylvania Avenue near Twenty-first Street. there a meeting was held to form a Hebrew Congregation in Washington. The Prayer Book at hand was printed in Hamburg, Germany, one of the cradles of Reform Judaism. By 1854 the number had grown to about forty. As the small group planned the construction of an edifice, they were concerned that Jewish community property ownership was not covered by the laws of the District of Columbia. Centuries of sad experience resulted in the submission of the Washington Hebrew Congregation to the first session of the Thirty-fourth Congress on February 5, 1856, an act of incorporation.\nThey received a bill recognizing the Jewish Congregations right to hold title, passed both houses and was signed by President Franklin Pierce, on June 2, 1856.\n\nThey found a site to build their synagogue, which had a modern history dating back to 1845. John P. Van Ness had donated to Trustees for the Central Presbyterian Church, certain lots on the west side of Eight Street between H and I Streets for the purpose of erecting a church building. The task of construction was completed by 1851 but bills for labor and material remained unpaid, the property, including the church was sold to Trustees of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. The Trustees of Washington Hebrew Congregation acquired the property by deed dated February 9, 1863. The Synagogue or Shule was dedicated July 31, 1863 by Dr. Isaac Leeser of Philadelphia as the Shaare Zedek Congregation. The next rapid growth of the congregation was driven by persecution mounting in Russia and Eastern Europe, altering Americas Jewish population from 250,000 in 1880 to over two million in 1915. The Congregation's 1890 Rabbi Stern was a city leader in religious unity, when he participated in a symposium of ministers of different faiths held at the turn of the century in DC and his was the first speech. He was a true pioneer in the Goodwill Movement and exchanged pulpits with many Christian ministers in his forty years and set the standard for the Congregation, which evolved into involvement in the Washington DC InterFaith Conference in 1978.\n\nIn 1896 the Synagogue took its current form. The Cornerstone of the Temple was laid September 16, 1897. Honored guests included President McKinley who used the same gavel that President George Washington used in laying the cornerstone of the Capitol Building. The Temple rebuilt by 1898 and dedicated as Temple Beth Elohim, the same name as the first Reformed Temple in America at Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nEarlier, on July 14, 1872, in Nashville, Tennessee, a son was bon to David and Rachel Simon. He was named Abram. He was born just as Dr. Stern began his rabbi services in Washington DC. At the age of 14 he entered the Hebrew Union College, graduating eight years later at the head of his class (1894). His degree was conferred by the great Dr. Isaac M. Wise, and at the commencement the yong Rabbi Simon, made the address for the class. Upon graduation, he was Rabbi of Temple Beth Israel in Sacramento, California. There he assisted in founding, and became Secretary of, the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children. He assisted in founding a non-sectarian memorial fund for the education of poor boys. Rabbi Simon lectured in Washington DC in late 1903. After the lecture, the Congregation determined Rabbi Simon was well fitted for the position as Rabbi of the Congregation. The Washington Evening Star, noted on November 17, 1903, that Dr. Simon was in the front ranks of Jewish rabbis of the United States.\n\nBy 1906 Rabbi Dr. Stern was working alongside the Rabbi Abram Simon, as both were serving together. However, just as Rabbi Stern had done over thirty years earlier, Rabbi Simmon stirred fresh spirit in the congregation. By 1912, connected with the Temple were 20 Societies composed of the members of the congregation. Among them are the Temple Sisterhood, consisting of 500 women members of the temple, of which Mrs. Abram Simon is president. Not only new services but new media can be associated with Rabbi Simon, who on October 25, 1922 he began Radio lecturing, a service in which he was speaking on December 24, 1938 when he sadly passed away of a heartattack.\n\nIn 1912 Rabbi Abram Simon invited 'Abdu'l-Baha leader of the Baha'i Faith to speak to the congregation. While he welcomed 'Abdu'l-Baha, the congregation was ill-prepared to receive such a revolutionary message, and became quite alarmed wishing him to finish his speech early. This reaction can be traced to the 40 years of teachings of Dr. Stern. Some explanation for the astonishment at the claims of Baha'u'llah with regards to progressive revelation as conveyed by 'Abdu'l-Baha to the congregation are explained by an action dating back 36 years. Already four years their Rabbi, in 1876, the community began to accept Dr. Sterns abandonment of a belief in a literal Messiah and a literal restoration of Zion. His abandonment of this belief was so shocking that even The Boston Herald took the opportunity to make it newsworthy on August 18, 1876. He apparently expressed well the sentiments of a Congregation beginning, but committed to, Reform. The National Jewish Ledger, on February, 1920 confirmed this mindset when describing Rabbi Dr. Stern: Rabbi Stern guarded the Jewish Right most sedulously, challenged attacks on Jews and Jewish customs and started the agitation for the elimination of the New Testament from the public schools.\" So it is clear that the congregation's acceptance of \"Abdu'l-Baha's talks was consistent with its progressive history of interfaith cooperation, however their shock at calls for acceptance of Jesus Christ and Muhammad were also to be expected. Rabbi Abram Simon, however, is of a different slant.\n\nGuides as to why Dr. Simon might have been interested in hearing 'Abdu'l-Baha out as portions of his congregation left, and asking his congregation to consider His message earnestly, then leading by example in following up personally to learn more are seen in his actions, talks and writings:\n\nHOW TO END THE PERSECUTION OF THE JEWS: The way to solve the problem (of persecution) is for the Jew to remain where he is, and by his own character, his own manhood, fling the lie in the face of his accusers. (1897). So Dr. Simon undertook his duties with humility, dedicated his life in scholarship and broad community activity to prove by his own character, his own manhood that the members of his faith are entitled to respect and tolerance. The guiding force of his belief in the force of character and manhood caused him to enlist in the Red Cross during the First War, where he served in Europe with distinction with the 79th Division. He was appointed a member of the Board of Education in 1919 and served as president 1920-through 1921. Dr. Simon was President of the Board of Columbia Hospital from 1921 to 1927 and of the Free Public Library from 1929 to 1933. In 1951 Abram School at 4th and Mississippi Avenue, SE was named in his honor, to serve as a permanent part of the educational facilities of the Public School System of the city.\n\nRELIGION WITHOUT CLERGY: Israel has no priesthood...every man is a priest. There is no caste, religious or social. All are sons of God. There is no distinction in Israel today or [of] clergy and laity. The title of Rabbi is one of leadership, won by scholarship, not by special appointment. (1907). Rabbi Simon served DC for 35 years to 1938. In the fourteen years between 1903-1917 Dr. Simon became an outstanding civic and nationally recognized figure in the Rabbinate. He was President of the Central Conference of American Rabbis 1924-1925. Rabbi Gerstenfeld on his passing, paid him respects as a scholar and a saint.\n\nPROGRESSION AND RELIGION: Dr. Simon got his Doctor of Philosophy at Columbia University entitled The Constructive Character and Function of Religion in Human Progress as Illustrated by the Religion of Israel, in 1907.\n\nUNITY OF GOD: Taken from the Congregation's Common prayer, in the Union Prayer-Book: \"O may all, created in Thine image, recognize that they are brethren, so that one inspirit and one in fellowship, they may be forever united before Thee.\" He continued Dr. Stern's exchange of pulpits with Christian ministers in this city and with rabbis elsewhere on occasions too numerous to mention. He was also a loyal Mason where his eloquence was in constant demand. He was active, indeed instrumental, in the formation of the Committee on Religious Life in Washington, consisting of ministers of various denominations; and was an ardent supporter of the Conference of Christians and Jews, waiting upon President Hoover at the First Convention of the Conference.\n\nIn 1919, 7 years after 'Abdu'l-Bahas visit Washington, Dr. Simon held a meeting in a room blessed by 'Abdu'l-Baha, Constitution Hall. The mass meeting represented a movement to obtain the active co-operation of ministers of all responsible religious groups -without any sacrifice of their special theological or ecclesiastical views- in stressing religion and church loyalty. The 7:45 mass was aimed at emphasizing the importance of religion and church attendance. It was the first gathering of its kind, the meeting had been organized by the Committee on Religious Life in the Nations Capital. It was believed that the meeting in DC will point the way to similar meetings in other cities.\n\nTwenty ministers were on the stage- Roman Catholics, Methodists, Jews (both Orthodox and Reform), Baptists, Presbyterians, Episcopalians and other denominations represented on the Committee on Religious life in the nations capital. Rabbi Abram Simon of the Washington Hebrew Congregation made a brief address, and the quartet of the Washington Hebrew Congregation also performed.\n\nIn 1955, the temple was sold to a Baptist church. They are now located at Washington Hebrew Congregation, 3935 Macomb St. NW . However, some of their membership still fondly recall dear Rabbi Simmon. On November 9, 1997, 83 year old Arthur Katims, said when I was a very young boy I heard Rabbi [Abram] Simon give a sermon here.. And it was one of the most beautiful things I ever heard. And it kept me in the faith to this day.\nTALKS 'Abdu'l-Baha DELIVERED IN WASHINGTON, D.C.\n\n8 November 1912 Talk at Home of Mr. and Mrs. Arthur J. Parsons 1700 Eighteenth Street, NW, Washington, D. C.\nNotes by Joseph H. Hannen\n\nThe address delivered last evening in the Jewish synagogue evidently disturbed some of the people, including the revered rabbi who called upon me this afternoon. Together we went over the ground again, which I shall now review for your benefit.\nIt was not possible to make the subject completely plain to the rabbi last night, as he was very much pressed for time, but today the opportunity was sufficient for a reconsideration of the statements in detail. I wish you to understand them thoroughly and memorize them in order that you may discourse with the Jews and thus, perchance, become instrumental in leading them aright.\n\nThe quintessence of our subject was this: What is the mission of the Prophet, and what is the object of a divine law? In answer we stated: There is no doubt that the purpose of a divine law is the education of the human race, the training of humanity. All mankind may be considered as pupils or children who are in need of a divine Educator, a real Teacher. The essential requirement and qualification of Prophethood is the training and guidance of the people. Therefore, we shall first consider the efficacy of the teachings of those who have been followed and accepted as the Prophets of God. The question that must be answered is: Have They taught mankind? Have They proved Themselves efficient Educators?\n\nAmong Them was Moses. We find that He appeared as the leader of the children of Israel during a period of their captivity. They were in a state of extreme humiliation, ignorance and heedlessness, living in a very lowly manner in Egypt under conditions of life worse than death. Imagine an ignorant people, downtrodden and oppressed, thoughtless, negligent and mentally darkened, held in subjection as slaves. Moses was appointed for their deliverance and training. He guided them, led them out of bondage into the Holy Land, uplifted them from ignorance and despair, trained them so that they rose from a condition of lowliness and subjection into one of honor and importance, and enabled them to reach a high degree of perfection. They became proficient in sciences and arts, attained a lofty plane of civilization, honorable and esteemed among nations, whereas formerly they had been lowly and despised. They were ignorant; they became intelligent, finally reaching that period of supremacy and power witnessed in the Solomonic 412 sovereignty. Their name became widespread throughout the world, and they were esteemed for distinct virtues. Even the philosophers of Greece went to Palestine to drink from the fountains of their wisdom and sit at the feet of their sages. All these facts prove that Moses was a Prophet and a Teacher.\n\nAs to Christ: He was a single, unique and lowly individual Who appeared at a time when the Israelitish nation had fallen from the heights of its glory to the lowest condition of bondage and contempt, subject to the tyranny of the Roman Empire, living under a yoke of humiliation, ignorant and negligent of God. The historical records of the Holy Books confirm these statements. Christ this single and unique Personage appeared amongst these despised and degraded people, reflecting a divine power and the potency of the Holy Spirit. He unified the various peoples and nations of the world, brought them together in fellowship and agreement and gathered them beneath the overshadowing protection of one Word. His prestige and mention were not confined to the children of Israel alone, who were at that time a limited race and people, but His spiritual power had also permeated and united great influential nations who had been warlike and hostile, such as the Romans, Greeks, Egyptians, Chaldeans, Syrians and Assyrians. He dispelled their hostility, healed their hatred, made them a united people, and by His Word created the utmost love amongst them so that they advanced immeasurably in the degrees of education and human perfection, thereby attaining a never-ending glory.\n\n\nThe Jews had become dispersed and widely scattered. This single and unique Personage overcame all the then known world, founding an everlasting sovereignty, a mighty nation indeed. Such a result proved Him to be a great man, the first Educator of His time, the first Teacher of His period. What proofs could be greater than these? What would be more convincing than this evidence that a single individual resuscitated so many nations and peoples, unified so many tribes and sects, removed so much warfare and hatred? Undoubtedly, such accomplishment could be wrought only through the power of God and not by mere human effort, which is altogether incapable of producing these mighty results.\n\nWhen Christ appeared, the Jews pronounced Him an enemy of Moses. Pharisaical rabbis of that age declared Him to be the destroyer of the Mosaic law and the institutes of the Torah. They proclaimed that He would bring great misfortune to the people of Israel, considering Him the violator of the holy Sabbath and destroyer of the Temple of Solomon. Therefore, they turned away 413 from Him. Let us investigate this and discover whether such accusations were true or false. We will find that in reality Christ caused the name and prestige of Moses to become widespread. Through His efforts and teaching the Book of Moses, the Bible, became known everywhere. In fifteen hundred years there had been but one translation of the Old Testament, the Torah, which translation was made from Hebrew into Greek. But through the instrumentality of Christs message and teachings it was translated into six hundred tongues and spread to every part of the world. All the kings and prophets of Israel were unable to promulgate the teachings of Judaism and the name of Moses beyond the borders of Palestine, whereas through Christ Judaism became an established religion in Asia, Africa, Europe and the world generally. Through the message of Christ, Moses was everywhere proclaimed a Prophet of God and His Book the Book of God. Shall we consider this Personage an enemy or a friend of Moses?\n\nJustice is needed; we must render fair judgment upon this question. Had He been an enemy, He would not have allowed the name and teachings of Moses to become widespread in the world. He would not have promulgated the law and principles of the Torah. Would there have been any mention of Moses in America? Could even the name of Judaism have reached this part of the world through any other instrumentality? Undoubtedly, it was owing to the blessed agency and influence of Christianity that Judaism became established in this western world. Moses had no better friend and sympathizer than Christ. Consider how the illiterate among the Israelites conceal the reality of these facts and continue the delusion that Christ was an enemy of Moses. All Christians believe in Moses. They declare that He was a Man of God, the Interlocutor and Prophet of God, that His Book was the Book of God, that the people of Israel were the people of God and that all the prophets of Israel were valid and true. They offer unlimited praise, sincere eulogy, and manifest unlimited love for the religion of Moses. What harm comes from this? And if the Jews should say that Christ was also the Word of God, the Spirit of God, what harm could follow this statement? Just these few words would be the cause of reconciling the Christians and Jews. The Christians accept Moses and His Book. What harm have they suffered on account of this belief? Have they lost anything because of it?\nIn answer to all these questions the rabbi answered, No.\n\nWe continued: What harm could result if the Jews were in a similar attitude toward Christianity, declaring that Christ was the 414 Word of God, that the Gospel is the Book of God? Such an attitude as this would cause the enmity of many centuries to pass away. If we declare that Moses was the Prophet of God and that His Book was the law of God, does it harm our religious standpoint? Not at all. Furthermore, every nation is proud of its great men and heroes even though those great ones may have been atheists or agnostics. Today France glorifies Napoleon Bonaparte, saying, He was a French military genius, whereas, in reality, he was a tyrant. They say, Voltaire was ours, although Voltaire was an atheist. Rousseau was a great man of this nation, and yet Rousseau was irreligious. France is proud of these great men. Feasts are held commemorating them, their names are perpetuated in special days, their memories treasured in prominent places, and there is music and celebration in their honor. The nation is proud of them. And now, do you consider these great men of France greater than Jesus of Nazareth? It is evident that in comparison with Jesus Christ they are as nothing. Consider the grandeur and majesty of Jesus in contrast with such men as we have mentioned. Consider Him from the standpoint of fame and renown. Where is the station of Christ, and where is their station? What comparison is there? In reality, Christ is incomparable. What harm, then, could come from your declaration that Jesus of Nazareth was a great man of Israelitish birth and, therefore, we love Him? That we have given to the world a great man indeed? That this mighty Personage, Whose Word has spread throughout the world, Who has conquered the East and the West, was an Israelite? Should you not be proud of Him? When you glorify and honor the memory of Christ, rest assured that the Christians will take your hands in real fellowship. All difficulty, hesitancy and restraint will vanish. Consider the troubles and persecutions heaped upon you in Russia for your fanaticism of unbelief. And you must not think that this is ended.\n\nThis humiliation will continue forever. The time may come when in Europe itself they will arise against the Jews. But your declaration that Christ was the Word of God will end all such trouble. My advice is that in order to become honorable, protected and secure among the nations of the world, in order that the Christians may love and safeguard the Israelitish people, you should be willing to announce your belief in Christ, the Word of God. This is a complete statement; there is nothing more. Is it not thoughtless, ignorant prejudice which restrains you from doing so? Declare that, verily, the Word of God was realized in Him, and all will be right.\n\nThe rabbi thoughtfully said, I believe that what you have said is perfectly true, but I must ask one thing of you. Will you not tell the Christians to love us a little more?\n\nWe replied, We have advised them and will continue to do so.",

              "Welcome to Dupont Circle, where the home of the First American Baha'i of African Descent and Phoebe Hearst who was known as \"the Mother of the Faithful\" lived at 1400 New Hampshire Avenue. While they lived here in Washington, their home was located at 1400 New Hampshire Ave, NW just off Dupont circle at the intersection of New Hampshire and O Streets. The house, designed by architect Robert Fleming, was built in 1883 for John Field, and sold to Secretary of the Treasury, Charles Fairchild, in 1888. When it was acquired in 1889 by California Senator William G. Hearst, it was redesigned from the Colonial Revival style into the Romanesque by architect Harvey Page. After Hearst died in 1891, his widow Phoebe Apperson Hearst lived there until 1902 when she sold the mansion, which became the Italian Embassy until 1925. Subsequently, it was used as a hotel, a club, the Russian Bible Society Headquarters (from 1948 to 1958), and the Cathedral Club Residence, until 1964, when it was demolished. Mr. Turner was in the employee of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst since the 1870s until his passing in 1909. The home hosted at least one gathering to teach the Baha'i Faith to the educators in charge of African-Descent education in the Nation's Capitol.\n\nAli Kuli Khan had long been the connection for Mr. Turner and Mrs. Hearst to the DC Baha'i community. During the Master's visit this was not different. In May 1912, Khan sent Phoebe Hearst a telegram saying, according to a draft, 'As a tribute to your broad services to cause of education the Persian Government has conferred upon you the highest gold decoration of learning just received with imperial charter. Am mailing you both today congratulations.' On May 20, she wired 'His Excellency Ali Kuli Khan' (after he became Charge, Khan and Florence began to be referred to, according to then prevailing custom, as His Excellency and Her Excellency). The wire was sent to the Persian Legation at 1832 16th Street, Washington, and said: 'Please present my sincere thanks to your government upon the honor so kindly conferred upon me and an assurance of my appreciation. Accept for yourself many thanks for your letters and to you I am indebted for the suggestion of such honors will telegraph on Wednesday regarding business matters Best wishes for all.'\n\nMR. ROBERT TURNER \"DISCIPLE OF ABDU'L-BAHA\"\n\nSometime in 1898, Mr. Robert Turner became the first African-American member of the Bahai Faith. He was an employee of Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, an early Bahai. Mr. Turner visited 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land (then Palestine, now Northern Israel), arriving on December 10, 1898 and staying into 1899. This was significant as being the first pilgrimage of Western believers to the Holy Land. Mr. Robert Turner was accompanied the first teacher of the Faith in America Mr. Ibrahim Khayru'llah, his neices and daughter, Lua Getsinger and Mrs. Phoebe Hearst, through the generosity of Mrs. Hearst.\nWhile in the Holy Land, 'Abdu'l-Baha displayed a great affection for Turner which stood in stark contrast to the conventions of interracial interaction in Western societies. In this way He modeled how true Bahai's should act towards all members of the human race. 'Abdu'l-Baha told Mr. Turner that if he remained firm and steadfast until the end, he would be the door through which a whole race would enter the Kingdom.\nAfter receiving a photo of Robert Turner prior to his visit to the Holy Land, 'Abdu'l-Baha wrote:\nO thous who are pure in heart, sanctified in spirit, peerless in character, beauteous in face! Thy photograph hath been received revealing thy physical frame in the utmost grace and best appearance. Thou art like unto the pupil of the eye which is dark in color, yet it is the fount of light and the revealer of the contingent world. (Shoghi Effendi, God Passes By, p 100)\nThe letter to Mr. Turner continued,\n\"I have not forgotten nor will I forget thee. I beseech God that He may graciously make thee the sign of His bounty amidst mandkind, illumine thy face with the light of such blessings as are vouchsafed by the merciful Lord, single thee out for His love in this age which is distingusihed among all the past ages and centuries.\"\nRobert Turner, is one of only nineteen Disciples of 'Abdu'l-Baha. Disciples of 'Abdu'l-Baha were eminent Western Bahais were thus designated by Shoghi Effendi for their steadfastness in the covenant. Washington D.C. had two such Bahais, Robert Turner and Joseph Hannen. In addition, Robert Turner is the first American of African descent to recognize Bahaullah.\n\nRobert Turner had begun his employment as an employee of George Hearst in 1871. When his employer George Hearst became Senator of California in 1886, Robert Turner, moved him to Washington, D.C., some thirteen years before the Faith arrived to D.C.. They lived at 1400 New Hampshire Avenue. While still residing in Washington, D.C., Robert Turners employer became Phoebe Hearst, who was widowed in February 1891. Phoebe Hearst continued to reside in Washington D.C. except for her frequent visits to San Francisco and occasional trips to Europe until 1902.\n\nSome time before 1898, Lua Getsinger, visited San Francisco. During this trip she called on Mrs. Hearst and spoke to her about the Bahai Faith. Louis G. Gregory has informed us that Robert Turner, her African-Descent butler, held a position of some responsibility in her household; he described him as faithful, dependable, and wise.\n\nRobert Turner let Mrs. Getsinger into the house and showed her into a finely furnished sitting-room. After giving her a gracious welcome, Mrs. Hearst asked her guest to sit down next to her on the sofa. When he had served the tea, Mr. Robert Turner stood near to them. In a moving manner, Mrs. Getsinger spoke to them both about the Bahai Faith. Surely on this occasion and those that followed Mr. Turner listened eagerly to Mrs. Getsinger and as a result did all that he could to learn about the Faith. In God Passes By Shoghi Effendi has referred to the fact that an African-Descent American, Robert Turner, was the first member of his race to embrace the Cause of Bahaullah in the West.\n\nTherefore, from some time in 1898 to 1902 the Washington D.C. community benefited from the spiritual presence of Robert Turner, the First African-Descent Bahai and the Disciple of 'Abdu'l-Baha, a few years before the first would declare in Washington that being Mrs. Pocahontas Pope in 1906. After returning from pilgrimage to Haifa in 1899, Robert Turner helped Mrs. Hearst organize the first presentation of the Bahai Faith to educators of the African-Descent community of Washington, D.C. at 1400 New. Hampshire Avenue.\n\nDeeply moved by what she had heard, in 1898 Mrs. Hearst decided to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land. She generously invited others to go along with her and made up a party which included Robert Turner. They traveled from Egypts Port Said in a small, boat to Haifa. Robert Turner arrived in a group with May Bolles, Miss Pearson, Ann Apperson, Mrs. Thornbugh to Haifa on the 16th of February 1899. The Hand of the Cause Louis Gregory has recorded one account of Mr. Robert Turners first meeting with 'Abdu'l-Baha. At sight of the master he dropped upon his knees and exclaimed: My Lord! My Lord! I am not worthy to be here! 'Abdu'l-Baha raised him to his feet, and embraced him like a loving father.\n\nA few days later, the first party of American pilgrims in the history of the Faith, visited 'Abdu'l-Baha in Akka. May Bolles described this meeting. On the morning of our arrival, after we had refreshed ourselves, the Master summoned us all to Him in a long room overlooking the Mediterranean. He sat in silence gazing out of the window, then looking up He asked if all were present. Seeing that one of the believers was absent, he said, Where is Robert?...In a moment Roberts radiant face appeared in the doorway and the Master rose to greet him, bidding him be seated, and said, Robert, your Lord loves you. God gave you a black skin, but a heart white as snow.\n\nWhen the Master led the party into the Most Holy Tomb and even into its innermost chamber, Robert was, of course, present. He, of no worldly importance, and brought along at least partly to serve Mrs. Hearst, was so greatly affected by the Masters most loving welcome and understanding treatment, that he became deeply convinced by Him of the Reality of Gods Cause for this day. The Master assured him that if he remained firm and steadfast until the end, he would be a door through which a whole race would enter the Kingdom.\n\nAs Shoghi Effendi has pointed out, The return of these God-intoxicated pilgrims, some to France, others to the United States, was the signal for an outburst of systematic and sustained activity, which, as it gathered momentum, and spread its ramifications over Western Europe and the states and provinces of the North American continent, grew to so great a scale that 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself resolved that as soon as He should be released form His prolonged confinement in Akka, He would undertake a personal mission to the West.\n\nAfter she had returned to her home in Washington, D.C., Mrs. Hearst gave a reception there for prominent educators of African Descent Americans. Mr. Gregory felt that she did this ...prompted no doubt by her experiences at Akka and her esteem for Robert Turner. She spoke to them all most ardently about the coming of Bahaullah.\n\nLater Mrs. Hearst became estranged from the Bahai Faith, by the sad actions of some Bahais who later left the Faith. Although much saddened that the world had thrown dust in the eyes of his beloved mistress, Mr. Robert Turner never wavered in his faith. His recognition of the Station of Bahaullah when Lua Getsinger was teaching Mrs. Hearst, and the confirmation that came to him from pilgrimage and most precious meeting with the Master, sustained him during this early period of the Faith when there were not only great bounties, but intense troubles.\n\nA few years after the pilgrimage in 1909, he became seriously ill, and was cared for by those who were not Bahais; ...his attendants heard him often repeat, even when delirious, an expression strange and unknown. On his death-bed, the last word that he spoke was the Greatest Name. Before his burial, the distinguished charge-daffairs of the Persian embassy Mirza Ali-Kuli Khan placed a Bahai ringstone upon his finger.\n\nThe following was written by Ali-Kuli Khan of this event:\n\nIn the spring of 1909 when I was in California as a guest of Mrs. Hearst and Pleasanton, Mrs. Hearst, who had informed me of the illness of Robert Turner... suggested my going with her to San Francisco to call on Robert. I found him quite ill in bed. He was happy to receive me and inquired of the news in Akka. He then, with great joy, described his visit to Akka in the company of Mrs. Hearst, a few years before the end of the last century. He asked me to write and send his love to the Master and to ask for His prayers.\n\nSoon after, I wrote the Master and described our visit with Robert Turner. In a Tablet which I received from the Master later in Washington, He wrote four lines regarding Robert Turner which I translate as follows\n\nConvey wondrous Abha greetings to Mr. Robert, the servant of that honorable lady, and say to him: Be not grieved at your illness, for thou hast attained eternal life and hast found thy way to the World of the Kingdom. God willing, we shall meet one another with joy and fragrance in that Divine World, and I beg of God that you may also find rest in this material world.\n\nIn the summer of 1909, I received from the Master a Tablet acknowledging my letter of June 22, in which I had reported death of Robert Turner. This letter came to me while I was spending the summer in Carmel, California with my family... This Tablet came in my name in care of Mrs. Goodall, California. On the second page of the original Persian Tablet, the Master writes as follows...\"\n\nThe letter to which Ali Kuli Khan referred is on the facing Baha page. The letter was prompted by Robert Turner's passing away on the 15th of June 1909. He is buried in Cypress Lawn Cemetery, Colma, CA which is just south of San Francisco.\n\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha on the passing of Disciple of 'Abdu'l-Baha Mr. Robert Turner:\n\nAs to Mr. Robert, the news of his ascension saddened the hearts. He was in reality in the utmost sincerity. Glory be to God! What a shining candle was aflame in that black-colored lamp. Praise be to God that that lighted candle ascended from the earthly lamp to the Kingdom of Eternity and gleamed and became aflame in the Heavenly Assemblage. Praise be to God that you adorned his blessed finger with the ring bearing the inscription: Verily I originated from God and returned unto Him...This too is a proof of his sincerity and that in his last breath, he breathed the Allah-u-Abha, whereby the hearts of those present were impressed.\nO Thou Creator! O Thou Forgiver! Glorify the precious Robert in Thy Kingdom and in the garden of the Paradise of Abha. Bring him in intimate association with the birds of the celestial meadow. O Thou Knowing God! Although that sinless one was black in color, like unto the black pupil of the eye, he was a source of shining light.\nThou forgiving Lord! Cause that longing one to attain Thy meeting and cause that thirsty one to drink the water of life in abundance. Thou art the Forgiver, the Pardoner, the Compassionate.\n\nIn the 1950s the American Baha'i Community placed a beautiful black granite gravestone over his grave in Caloma, California next to Mrs. Hearsts' grave.\n\nPHOEBE HEARST Mother of the Faithful\n\n\nPhoebe Elizabeth Apperson was born in Franklin County, Missouri, December 3, 1842. She loved education and became a teacher. This did not bring her much money though so she was very poor. Her life changed dramatically when she and mining phenom George Hearst were married on June 15, 1862 at Steelville, Missouri. After married they traveled to the west by way of New York, then Panama. There was no Canal then. It was a journey overland which proved fatal to many, leading as it did through jungle country, alive with parrots, monkeys and snakes, poisonous insects and yellow fever. Together, Phoebe and George Hearst acquired beautiful homes. Their name became a household word. Phoebe, thirsting for knowledge, studied French, history, politics, art, literature. In 1874 they lost everything during the speculation panic, but after a year in a boarding house and selling their houses, horses and carriages they returned to wealth. In 1886-1891 the Governor of California appointed George Hurst a Senator and the Hearst's moved to Washington, D.C., their employee Robert Turner moved with them. With only two years of schooling George Hearst had become a United States Senator and given away to education and charity over fifty million dollars. They moved into a house in Washington, D.C. at 1400 New Hampshire Avenue.\n\nDuring this time together in DC, Phoebe and George: established kindergartens, helped the Polyclinic Hospital, relieved the suffering of the Charleston earthquake, held receptions to aid charities and aided struggling artists. This work of Phoebes would only intensify after Georges passing.\n\nGeorge Hearst, died in Washington on February 28, 1891 - he was carried back to San Francisco on a mourning train full of dignitaries, for a service in Grace Episcopal Church. They buried him in a mausoleum at Cypress Point, where Phoebe would not join him for twenty-eighty years. Senator Hearst left Phoebe, then forty-eight, in control of an enormous fortune.\n\nFrom 1891 to 1902, Phoebe Hearst resided in Washington D.C. except for frequent visits to San Francisco and occasional trips to Europe, Africa and the Holy Land until 1900. Phoebe was dedicated to community services and using her vast resources for the betterment of others. Foremost amongst her achievements in DC was being the co-founder of the Parent-Teacher Association in 1897. Also in 1897 she was elected vice president at the first meeting of National Congress of Mothers in Washington D.C. She spent tremendous energy and resources restoring Mount Vernon, the first American Presidents home, from ruin and restored its historic furniture for all future generations. Finally, in D.C. she built the National Cathedral School for Girls in Washington in 1902 which endures successfully today. It was her wish to establish a school in Washington which would offer a superior academic program for young women, and did so by teaming with the guidance of the Episcopal church.\n\nLess well known is that during her frequent stays in San Francisco, Lua Getsinger taught her and her butler the Bahai Faith. Deeply moved by what she had heard, in 1898 Mrs. Hearst decided to investigate the Faith of Bahaullah more deeply. She set out to visit 'Abdu'l-Baha in the Holy Land personally. Phoebe Hearst was stirred into this action by the message that another Manifestation of God had only recently walked the earth, she organized a party of friends and attendants to go as her guests to see 'Abdu'l-Baha where He was being held captive in the prison city of Akka. In February 1898, thanks to Mrs. Hearsts leadership, the first party of American pilgrims, the first party of Christian pilgrims in history, visited the Holy Tombs of the Bahai Faith and 'Abdu'l-Baha in Akka. The expression for going on pilgrimage in those days was attaining to Akka.\n\nTheir numbers grew to fifteen when they neared the Holy Land, and because so many coming at one time would have alerted the Turkish authorities, they divided into small groups, the first arriving at Akka December 10, 1898. When the Master led the party into the Most Holy Tomb and even into its innermost chamber. The effect of this pilgrimage was the true birth of the Faith in the West:\n\nAs Shoghi Effendi has described it, The return of these God-intoxicated pilgrims, some to France, others to the United States, was the signal for an outburst of systematic and sustained activity, which, as it gathered momentum, and spread its ramifications over Western Europe and the states and provinces of the North American continent, grew to so great a scale that 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself resolved that as soon as He should be released form His prolonged confinement in Akka, He would undertake a personal mission to the West.\n\nMrs. Hearst remained in the fortress-city of Akka three days. This city which had stopped the horrific war of Napoleon to conquer the East only a century before, was now the temple in which East and West were uniting in love.\n\nWhen bidding farewell to a body of pilgrims 'Abdu'l-Baha said, Although I lacked the time to answer all the letters you brought me from your cities, you yourselves are the real letters that I am sending in reply. For letters are of two kinds: ordinary, written ones, and living ones. The living letters are the beloved of god, for they are the Luminous Book in which the mysteries of creation can be read. Those who act in accord with the urgings of the Blessed Perfection are as eloquent volumes which no amount of reading can ever exhaust.\n\nDuring the pilgrimage 'Abdu'l-Baha blessed Phoebe Hearst with the title Mother of the Faithful. Also, during the pilgrimage, she was so deeply move by the chanting of an Arabic prayer during the pilgrimage that fourteen years later she told her guests of it, when 'Abdu'l-Baha visited her in San Francisco, and yielding to her request He chanted a similar prayer in His powerful voice in October,1912. These and other experiences prompted Phoebe Hearst, after her pilgrimage to describe them as the best days of her life:\n\nThose three days were the most memorable days of my life...I believe with all my heart that He is the Master, and my greatest blessing in this world is that I have been privileged to be in His presence.\n\nAfter she had returned to her home in Washington, D.C., Mrs. Hearst gave a reception there for prominent educators of African-Descent Americans. Mr. Gregory felt that she did this ...prompted no doubt by her experiences at Akka and her esteem for Robert Turner. She spoke to them all most ardently about the coming of Bahaullah. This 1898, public proclamation was most likely the first, however indirectly, to African-Descent Americans about the Cause of God in the United States of America, and Washington D.C. in particular.\n\nOn the west coast Lua Getsinger was the principle teacher of the Faith to Mrs. Hearst, in Washington D.C. it was likely Ali Kuli Khan. Phoebe Hearst was much impressed with Ali Kuli Khans abilities during the years when he served as translator for Mirza Abu-l-Fadl in Washington and had thought of sending him to Harvard at her expense.\n\nNow, with Mirza and Khan in Washington, Mrs. Hearst was anxious to discuss with them various plans for promoting the Faith. For one thing, she felt Khan should enroll at Harvard, the better to equip himself for future services. Khan explained that the Master had sent him to America to translate Bahai writings, including Mirzas book, and that he was working at least fifteen hours a day. Since, however, Mrs. Hearst had been accepted as a Bahai by 'Abdu'l-Baha Himself and had received from Him the title Mother of the Faithful, Mirza thought her suggestion should be communicated immediately to the Master.\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha approved Mrs. Hearsts suggestion, provided the sum to be made available was moderate. So far as Khan could remember, he was to receive fifty dollars each month while at Harvard. The Harvard education was never to be, as the San Francisco believers used her money for their selfish purposes which caused Phoebe to draw back disillusioned from a number of projects, including the Harvard one, 7 years later in 1909.\n\nKhan was able to convince Mrs. Hearst that irresponsible acts by individuals could hardly be blamed on the Bahai Faith, and that Bahais were not interested in her because of her fortune, but because of her being a believer. From then on until she died, she remained firm in the Faith, and it was through Khan that she carried on a correspondence with 'Abdu'l-Baha until her death in 1919. The following example shows the depth of friendship between the two:\n\nIn August,1910 Khan wrote Phoebe Hearst from the Park Avenue Hotel in New York upon his return form Persia. He says he thanked God for bringing him safely back, and tells Mrs. Hearst with feeling: I am grateful to you for your kindness and benevolence to which i owe all the success of my journey. This journey had earned Khan an appointment as charge dAffaires for Persia in 1910.\n\nThis correspondence continued right to her death, in 1919. For instance, she played the important role of reuniting the Bahai World with Disciple of 'Abdu'l-Baha Mr. Robert Turner when he was sick and ailing. She was also afforded the honor to have 'Abdu'l-Baha visit her and travel with the Master in 1912 at the western most point of his Western travels.\n\nHowever, her contacts were much wider, and she corresponded also with Sarah Farmer the founder of the Green Acre Bahai school from 1897 to 1904, at least 22 times. It should be said that Phoebe A. Hearst was truly the Mother of the Faithful, and could well be said to have influenced the entire growth and direction of the Faith in the West both through her pilgrimage and her sustained activity thereafter.\n\n\n'Abdu'l-Baha praises her as the servant of Baha, the mother of the Faithful. He writes that she had sincerely turned unto her Master.completley faced toward the Kingdom of God... shall surely have a firm and steady footing in the Cause of God, her face shall shine forth form the Horizon of Loftiness, her fame shall be spread in the Kingdom of God, and ...shall have a ringing voice...and the light of her glorious deeds shall beam forth during cycles and ages.\n\nPhoebe Hears is buried in Cypress Lawn Cemetery, Colma, CA at the Corner of Sections E and H.\n\n\nCarefully preserved in Ali Kuli Khan's papers is a clipping from the of April 14, 1919, with the following headline and subheads:\nPhoebe Hearst Dies After Long Illness at 76\nPhilanthropist, Leader of Society and Mother of Publisher, Expires at Her Home in California\nGave Much in Charities\n\nEndowed Many Libraries and Schools and Relieved Poor by Thousands\nPhoebe had died at the Hacienda the previous day. She had been ill several weeks. Her only child, William Randolph Hearst, was with her when the end came.\nThe article, part legend at variance with the Fremont Olders' more accurate account (Fremont Older was an editor for William Randolph Hearst, his wife Cora an established author, and Hearst himself read their book in manuscript) says she was governess-reared but was 'of those hardy American pioneers who went into the West of trackless deserts and dangerous mountains ... shared the hardships of her husband, the late Senator Hearst, who won millions from mines ... gave to the unfortunates in rough mining camps something of her own courage and developed early the rule of \"help the individual to help himself.\" This maxim she took as a guide in the life of philanthropic work to which she devoted herself.'\nThe paper says she gave away 'probably millions', was a patron of the arts, and made gifts and loans to art institutions.\nBeginning in 1886, her husband by then a Senator, she became a social leader in Washington, traveled, went around the world. She collected treasures and had to build a special storehouse of reinforced concrete to house those valuables not lent or given to museums.\nPhoebe Hearst gave over one million to the University of California at Berkeley, including the Hearst Memorial Mining Building , which cost $800,000, and twenty scholarships for women. The National Cathedral School for Girls at Washington was one of her gifts. She founded libraries and kindergartens, and encouraged women's organizations. (The article does not mention what is usually said of her today, that she co-founded the National Congress of Parents and Teachers, better known as the PTA.)\nKhan was in Paris as a delegate to the Peace Conference at Versailles when news of Phoebe's passing reached him through the press. Marzieh was with him, going somewhere by bus that day, and was much embarrassed to see him weeping on a public conveyance, the passengers implacably staring. Parents are embarrassment enough to children in any case, and this was too much, and so lingered in memory.\nCertainly the 'Mother of the Faithful', from wherever she then was, could look down and be sure that here, at least in this one heart, there was true sorrow. Who knows, perhaps Khan was also weeping over times past, and Mirza, and Eleanor, and the days of his lost youth. For such purgings are brought on by a mourned death, and ease the hoarded grief.\n\nPhoebe was survived by her son William Randolph Hearst who died in Beverly Hills, Calif., on Aug. 14,1951. He is considered a very dominating figure in 20th century communications. During his career in newspapers, magazines, radio and film broadcasting, he changed the face of the way mass media would be seen throughout the world. All of her grandsons followed her sons glory into media and became very successful. Today, Hearst Corp. owns 12 newspapers including the San Francisco Examiner. Hearst Corp. also owns 25 magazines including Cosmopolitan.\n\nIn 1912 specifically, William Randolph Hearst was busy with the political process. The Republican split had raised the prospect of a national Democratic victory. As the democratic convention approached, the front-runners were Champ Clark of Missouri, Speaker of the House, longtime supporter of reform, and, as the choice of William Randolph Hearst, the beneficiary of endless free publicity and propaganda from the nationwide chain of Hearst newspapers; Clarks candidacy was initially considered something of a joke by many Democrats, but he proved popular among many ex-Bryan supporters in the west and Midwest, and the constant plugging from Hearst newspapers around the country took its toll. After a surprisingly massive victory in the Illinois primary on April 9, Clark became the front-runner in the pre-convention campaign. Clark entered the Baltimore convention with the most delegates, followed in order by Wilson, Harmon, and Underwood. The first ballot gave Clark 440 delegates, Wilson 324, Harmon 148, Underwood 117 and a few dozen more scattered among others. Much later, on ballot 46, Wilson was nominated with 990 votes.",

              "Welcome to the seven story Mendota, at 2220 20th Street NW, where the Master visited Mme. Josephine Cowles de Lagnel, known in part as the loving surrogate mother for 'Alí-Kuli Khán in Washington, DC. She called on Mírzá Abu'l-Fadl and Khán in Washington, while grieving over the loss of her only son. Upon receiving the Faith, her heart was less burdened. She went on pilgrimage to see the Master, a singular event which was recorded upon her gravestone in St. Paul's Cemetery when she passed away in 1931.\nDuring His trips to Washington, DC, the Master visited the de Lagnels several times in their large apartment at the Mendota, near Kalorama and Columbia Road. Unfortunately, Col. de Lagnel passed away and, in November 1912, the Master traveled with Mme. Josephine Cowles de Lagnel to St. Paul's Cemetery to commemorate his passing. \n'Abdu'l-Bahá wrote the following tablet for Mme. de Lagnel:\n“To the Maid-servant of God! Mrs. Josephine Cowles.Upon her be Bahá'u'lláh!\n“HE IS GOD!\n“O thou who art cheered in soul by the Fragrances of God!Verily I read thy words of thanksgiving to God for He hath guided thee to the Light of Guidance, caused thee to hear the Call from the Supreme Concourse, shown unto thee His mighty Signs and made thee a herald in His Name among mankind.\n“Blessed art thou for thou hast received teachings from His Holiness, Professor Abu'l-Fadl, and hast visited His Honor Khán with all joy, happiness and fragrance.\n“Verily, God shall surely confirm thee with the Spirit of Life, thou art in the Ark of Deliverance, and He shall chant unto thee the verses of steadfastness, that thou mayest keep firm at the violence of tests and against the power of trials.\n“Verily, God hath already forgiven thy fortunate son who hath ascended to the Supreme Friend, and verily he addresses thee in the most wonderful explanation and says: O my loving mother! “O that my people would know that my Lord hath forgiven me, and made me of those who have attained.\n“As to thee! Know thou verily, the winds of tests shall surely wax violent in those regions, and will pull out (certain) trees from their roots. But the firm ones, their Lord will assist them with the greatest powers, and will stand trials even as solid mountains with-stand whirl-winds, hurricanes and storms. Know thou verily, every firm one will be well rooted through the Grace of thy Lord, and the Lord of the Kingdom will assist him with the hosts of His Holy Realm of Might and with the Angels of His Kingdom, from all directions.\n“I beg of God that thou mayest be of them (firm ones) and withstand every whirl-wind, shock, violence and calamity.\n“(Signed) 'Abdu'l-Bahá ‘Abbás.\n“Translated by A.K Khán.Jan. 23, 1903.”\nThe Mendota, built in 1901, was the tallest building north of the city when the Master visited it and was known as the premier luxury apartment house at the time. Its architect, James G. Hill, had moved to Washington in 1862. His first notable building was the Old Bureau of Engraving and Printing in 1879. The Mendota was financed by the Iowa Apartment House Company. When it opened in 1901, the building attracted high-level government officials like George W. Norris (House Representative of Ohio, 1903-1913). The building features decorative terra cotta details. The building boasts a molded cornice above the second floor and another under the seventh floor with a denticulated cornice at the roofline. There are also decorative terra cotta panels on the seventh floor between the windows. This area was originally part of 600-acre tract surveyed in 1664 known as \"Widow's Mite.\"",
              "mural",
              "The interior and exterior of the building remain largely unaltered since the Master’s visit, maintaining elements like the foyer’s marble staircase. In 1952, the Mendota's ownership was transferred to a cooperative. In 1971, the DC Human Rights Commission issued its first finding of racial discrimination since its establishment in 1958 against the building. In 2010, the two historic elevators were rebuilt."

              "Welcome to the home of the Fuhrmans, at 24 Quincy Place NE, where the Master visited and sat in their reception upon furniture which has been preserved to this day.\nThe conscientious Bahá'í family consisted of Edward Fuhrman (47 at the time of the Master's 1912 visit), Carrie E. Cook Fuhrman (38), her mother Emily Cook (85) and their children, Ruth Fuhrman (13), Elsie Elizabeth Fuhrman (11) and Edward Cook Fuhrman Jr. (8). The family, who declared in 1906, was careful to preserve the chair upon which the Master sat, and donated it to the DC community.\nAt Naw-Rúz in 1910, the Fuhrmans’ daughter Ruth presided over the celebration. The National Newsletter describes the event stating, \"The Feast of Naurooz, March 21, was given by the children of our Sunday School, and was well attended. Those present pronounced the exercises most effective. Our dear little sister, Ruth Fuhrman, eleven years old, presided with dignity.\"\nThe Bahá'í Newsletter of the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of the United States and Canada describes the family’s sincere devotion to the Cause in this eulogy for daughter Ruth in February 1926:\n“On the morning of December 24th,1925, the friends in Washington sorrowfully learned of the sudden passing of Miss Ruth Fuhrman, daughter of Mr. and Mrs. Edward Fuhrman, and sister of Mrs. Elsie Fuhrman Cook and Edward Fuhrman, Jr. Ruth had been more or less frail for some time, due to pernicious aenemia, but the final dissolution was sudden and entirely unexpected.\n“The family became Baha’is twenty years ago when Ruth was but six years of age, and they developed through the pure utterances of God, and advanced in the Cause as one soul. A united loyal family, much honored and beloved for their sincerity and devotion to the Cause, always faithful followers of the Light.\n“In these recent years she had been particularly active in the local Junior Baha’i group. How kind she was! What a devoted sister to the young people! Always impartial, loving all, and serving all alike. She had been rather frail for some weeks, but many times forced herself to go to the Junior class on Sunday mornings. The last time she attended she was so tired and her heart was so weak, that she had to rest on each step leading to the class room. The ‘candle was weeping its life away drop by drop’ even then.\n“The funeral service held at the Fuhrman residence was conducted by Mr. Allen B. McDaniel. A very large majority of the friends in Washington were in attendance, as well as many outside of the Cause from among the Jews, Catholics, Christian Scientists and others. And again at the cemetery the service was continued with the reading of the Holy Words of God.\n“‘We cannot realize in this world the Bounty of God, nor can we appreciate His love. But in the next world we can do so.’ And again He said to one of the friends: ‘Be not grieved at the death of thy dear daughter. That divine bird flew away to the rose garden of the Merciful, and that plant of humanity hastened to the garden of the Kingdom of El Ahha. That drop returned to the Most Great Sea and that ray betook herself to the Most Great Orb. Be happy and thankful, because thou wilt see her shining in the Divine Kingdom and wilt find her as a lamp amid an assembly in the spiritual heaven.’\"\nThe two story residence was built in 1900.",
