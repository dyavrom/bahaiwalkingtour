# bahaiwalkingtour

This is all the code used for the DC Bahai Walking Tour app found here
https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dc-baha%C3%AD-walking-tour/id1533126889#?platform=ipad

The code can be used to recreate the same functionality for any city in the world.

The main consideration is to format the data.json file exactly the way its shown. Upon doing that, your data should load perfeclty well. 

To do so, use the csvtojson project also in my github. That will format your csv to the proper specifications. Also watch out for any errant  special characters, as they can cause serious formatting issues when published in the app.

If you have any questions, please feel free to reach out at dyavrom@gmail.com

Thanks!
